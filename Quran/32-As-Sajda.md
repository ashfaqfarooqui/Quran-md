IT IS GOD who has created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six aeons, and is established on the throne of His almightiness. You have none to protect you from God, and none to intercede for you [on Judgment Day]: will you not, then, bethink yourselves? ^qAsad324

For, [many are] they [who] say, “What! After we have been [dead and] lost in the earth, shall we indeed be [restored to life] in a new act of crea­tion?” Nay, but [by saying this] they deny the truth that they are destined to meet their Sustainer! ^qAsad3210

Wa law taraaa izil mujrimoona naakisoo ru'oosihim 'inda rabbihim rabbanaaa absarnaa wa sami'naa farji'naa na'mal saalihan innaa mooqinoon ^qTrans3212


If thou couldst but see [how it will be on Judgment Day], when those who are lost in sin will hang their heads before their Sustainer, [saying:] “O our Sustainer! [Now] we have seen, and we have heard! Return us, then, [to our earthly life] that we may do good deeds: for [now], behold, we are certain [of the truth]!” ^qAsad3212

Wa law shi'naa la-aatainaa kulla nafsin hudaahaa wa laakin haqqal qawlu minnee la amla'anna jahannama minal jinnati wannaasi ajma'een ^qTrans3213


Yet had We so willed, We could indeed have imposed Our guidance upon every human being: but [We have not willed it thus - and so] that word of Mine has come true: “Most certainly will I fill hell with invisible beings as well as with humans, all together!” ^qAsad3213

[And He will say unto the sinners:] “Taste, then, [the recompense] for your having been obli­vious of the coming of this your Day [of Judgment] - for, verily, We are [now] oblivious of you: taste, then, [this] abiding suffering for all [the evil] that you were wont to do!” ^qAsad3214


So taste (the evil of your deeds). Forasmuch as ye forgot the meeting of this your day, lo! We forget you. Taste the doom of immortality because of what ye used to do. ^qPickthall3214

Falaa ta'lamu nafsum maaa ukhfiya lahum min qurrati a'yunin jazaaa'am bimaa kaanoo ya'maloon ^qTrans3217


And [as for all such believers,] no human being can imagine what blissful delights, as yet hidden, await them [in the life to come] as a reward for all that they did. ^qAsad3217

Afaman kaana mu'minan kaman kaana faasiqaa; laa yasta woon ^qTrans3218


Is, then, he who [in his earthly life] was a believer to be compared with one who was in­iquitous? [Nay,] these two are not equal! ^qAsad3218


Is he who is a believer like unto him who is an evil-liver? They are not alike. ^qPickthall3218


What? Is he who has been a believer like unto him who has been ungodly? They are not equal. ^qArberry3218

# 19

Ammal lazeena aamanoo wa 'amilus saalihaati falahum jannaatul maawa nuzulam bimaa kaanoo ya'maloon ^qTrans3219


As for those who attain to faith and do right­eous deeds - gardens of rest await them, as a wel­come [from God], in result of what they did; ^qAsad3219


But as for those who believe and do good works, for them are the Gardens of Retreat - a welcome (in reward) for what they used to do. ^qPickthall3219


As for those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, there await them the Gardens of the Refuge, in hospitality for that they were doing. ^qArberry3219

but as for those who are lost in iniquity - their goal is the fire: as oft as they will try to come out of it, they will be thrown back into it; and they will be told, “Taste [now] this suffering through fire which you were wont to call a lie!” ^qAsad3220


And as for those who do evil, their retreat is the Fire. Whenever they desire to issue forth from thence, they are brought back thither. Unto them it is said: Taste the torment of the Fire which ye used to deny. ^qPickthall3220


But as for the ungodly, their refuge shall be the Fire; as often as they desire to come forth from it, they shall be restored into it, and it shall be said to them, 'Taste the chastisement of the Fire, which you cried lies to.' ^qArberry3220

# 21

Wa lanuzeeqan nahum minal 'azaabil ladnaa doonal 'azaabil akbari la'allahum yarji'oon ^qTrans3221


However, ere [We condemn them to] that supreme suffering, We shall most certainly let them taste of a suffering closer at hand, so that they might [repent and] mend their ways. ^qAsad3221


And verily We make them taste the lower punishment before the greater, that haply they may return. ^qPickthall3221


And We shall surely let them taste the nearer chastisement, before the greater; haply so they will return. ^qArberry3221

# 22

Wa man azlamu mimman zukkira bi aayaati rabbihee summa a'rada 'anhaa; innaa minal mujrimeena muntaqimmon ^qTrans3222


And who could be more wicked than he to whom his Sustainer’s messages are conveyed and who thereupon turns away from them? Verily, We shall inflict Our retribution on those who are [thus] lost in sin! ^qAsad3222


And who doth greater wrong than he who is reminded of the revelations of his Lord, then turneth from them. Lo! We shall requite the guilty. ^qPickthall3222


And who does greater evil than he who is reminded of the signs of his Lord, then turns away from them? We shall take vengeance upon the sinners. ^qArberry3222

# 23

Wa laqad aayainaa Moosal Kitaaba falaa takun fee miryatim mil liqaaa'ihee wa ja'alnaahu hudal li Baneee Israaa'eel ^qTrans3223


AND, INDEED, [O Muhammad,] We did vouchsafe revelation unto Moses [as well]: so be not in doubt of [thy] having met with the same [truth in the revelation vouchsafed to thee]. And [just as] We caused that [earlier revelation] to be a guidance for the children of Israel, ^qAsad3223


We verily gave Moses the Scripture; so be not ye in doubt of his receiving it; and We appointed it a guidance for the Children of Israel. ^qPickthall3223


Indeed, We gave Moses the Book; so he not in doubt concerning the encounter with him; and We appointed it for a guidance to the Children of Israel. ^qArberry3223

# 24

Wa ja'alnaa minhum a'immatany yahdoona bi amrinaa lammaa sabaroo wa kaanoo bi aayaatinaa yooqinoon ^qTrans3224


and [as] We raised among them leaders who, so long as they bore themselves with patience and had sure faith in Our messages, guided [their people] in accordance with Our behest [so, too, shall it be with the divine writ revealed unto thee, O Muhammad.] ^qAsad3224


And when they became steadfast and believed firmly in Our revelations, We appointed from among them leaders who guided by Our command. ^qPickthall3224


And We appointed from among them leaders guiding by Our command, when they endured patiently, and had sure faith in Our signs. ^qArberry3224

# 25

Inna rabbaka huwa yafsilu bainahum yawmal qiyaamati feemaa kaanoo feehi yakhtalifoon ^qTrans3225


VERILY, it is God alone who will decide between men on Resurrection Day with regard to all on which they were wont to differ. ^qAsad3225


Lo! thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ. ^qPickthall3225


Surely thy Lord will distinguish between them on the Resurrection Day, touching that whereon they were at variance. ^qArberry3225

# 26

Awalam yahdi lahum kam ahlaknaa min qablihim minal qurooni yamshoona fee zaalika la aayaatin afalaa yasma'oon ^qTrans3226


[But] can, then, they [who deny the truth] learn no lesson by recalling how many a generation We have destroyed before their time? [people] in whose dwelling-places they [themselves now] walk about? In this, behold, there are messages indeed: will they not, then, listen? ^qAsad3226


Is it not a guidance for them (to observe) how many generations We destroyed before them, amid whose dwelling places they do walk? Lo! therein verily are portents! Will they not then heed? ^qPickthall3226


Is it not a guidance to them, how many generations We destroyed before them in whose dwelling-places they walk? Surely in that are signs; what, will they not hear? ^qArberry3226

# 27

Awalam yaraw annaa nasooqul maaa'a ilal lardil juruzi fanukhriju bihee zar'an taakulu minhu an'aamuhum wa anfusuhum afalaa yubsiroon ^qTrans3227


Are they not aware that it is We who drive the rain onto dry land devoid of herbage, and thereby bring forth herbage of which their cattle and they themselves do eat? Can they not, then, see [the truth of resurrection]? ^qAsad3227


Have they not seen how We lead the water to the barren land and therewith bring forth crops whereof their cattle eat, and they themselves? Will they not then see? ^qPickthall3227


Have they not seen how We drive the water to the dry land and bring forth crops therewith whereof their cattle and themselves eat? What, will they not see? ^qArberry3227

# 28

Wa yaqooloona mataa haazal fat hu in kuntum saadiqeen ^qTrans3228


But they answer: “When will that final decision take place, if what you [believers] say is true?” ^qAsad3228


And they say: When cometh this victory (of yours) if ye are truthful? ^qPickthall3228


They also say, 'When shall be this Victory, if you speak truly?' ^qArberry3228

# 29

Qul yawmal fat hi laa yanfa'ul lazeena kafarooo eemaanuhum wa laa hum yunzaroon ^qTrans3229


Say: “On the Day of the Final Decision, their [newly-found] faith will be of no use to those who [in their lifetime] were bent on denying the truth, nor will they be granted respite!” – ^qAsad3229


Say (unto them): On the day of the victory the faith of those who disbelieve (and who then will believe) will not avail them, neither will they be reprieved. ^qPickthall3229


Say: 'On the Day of Victory their faith shall not profit the unbelievers, nor shall they be respited.' ^qArberry3229

# 30

Fa a'rid 'anhum wantazir innahum muntazirron ^qTrans3230


and then leave them alone, and wait [for the truth to unfold as] they, behold, are waiting. ^qAsad3230


So withdraw from them (O Muhammad), and await (the event). Lo! they (also) are awaiting (it). ^qPickthall3230


So turn thou away from them, and wait; they too are waiting. ^qArberry3230
