Yaaa ayyuhan naasuttaqoo Rabbakum; inna zalzalatas Saa'ati shai'un 'azeem ^qTrans210


O men! Be conscious of your Sustainer: for, verily the violent convulsion of the Last Hour will be an awesome thing! ^qAsad210

Yawma tarawnahaa tazhalu kullu murdi'atin 'ammaaa arda'at wa tada'u kullu zaati hamlin hamlahaa wa tarannaasa sukaaraa wa maa hum bisukaaraa wa lakinaa 'azaabal laahi shadeed ^qTrans211


On the Day when you behold it, every woman that feeds a child at her breast will utterly forget her nursling, and every woman heavy with child will bring forth her burden [before her time]; and it will seem to thee that all mankind is drunk, although they will not be drunk - but vehement will be [their dread of] God’s chastisement. ^qAsad211


On the day when ye behold it, every nursing mother will forget her nursling and every pregnant one will be delivered of her burden, and thou (Muhammad) wilt see mankind as drunken, yet they will not be drunken, but the Doom of Allah will be strong (upon them). ^qPickthall211


on the day when you behold it, every suckling woman shall neglect the child she has suckled, and every pregnant woman shall deposit her burden, and thou shalt see mankind drunk, yet they are not drunk, but God's chastisement is terrible. ^qArberry211

Wa minan naasi mai yujaadilu fil laahi bighairi 'ilminw wa yattabi'u kullaa shaitaanim mareed ^qTrans212


And yet, among men there is many a one who argues about God without having any knowledge [of Him], and follows every rebellious satanic force ^qAsad212


Among mankind is he who disputeth concerning Allah without knowledge, and followeth each froward devil; ^qPickthall212


And among men there is such a one that disputes concerning God without knowledge and follows every rebel Satan, ^qArberry212

Kutiba 'alaihi annahoo man tawallaahu fa annahoo yudil lauhoo wa yahdeehi ilaa 'azaabis sa'eer ^qTrans213


about which it has been decreed that whoever entrusts himself to it, him will it lead astray and guide towards the suffering of the blazing flame! ^qAsad213


For him it is decreed that whoso taketh him for friend, he verily will mislead him and will guide him to the punishment of the Flame. ^qPickthall213


against whom it is written down that whosoever takes him for a friend, him he leads astray, and he guides him to the chastisement of the burning. ^qArberry213

O MEN! If you are in doubt as to the [truth of] resurrection, [remember that,] verily, We have created [every one of] you out of dust, then out of a drop of sperm, then out of a germ-cell, then out of an embryonic lump complete [in itself] and yet incom­plete so that We might make [your origin] clear unto you. And whatever We will [to be born] We cause to rest in the [mothers’] wombs for a term set [by Us], and then We bring you forth as infants and [allow you to live] so that [some of] you might attain to maturity: for among you are such as are caused to die [in childhood], just as many a one of you is reduced in old age to a most abject state, ceasing to know anything of what he once knew so well. And [if, O man, thou art still in doubt as to resur­rection, consider this:] thou canst see the earth dry and lifeless - and [suddenly,] when We send down waters upon it, it stirs and swells and puts forth every kind of lovely plant! ^qAsad214


O mankind! if ye are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, then lo! We have created you from dust, then from a drop of seed, then from a clot, then from a little lump of flesh shapely and shapeless, that We may make (it) clear for you. And We cause what We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed time, and afterward We bring you forth as infants, then (give you growth) that ye attain your full strength. And among you there is he who dieth (young), and among you there is he who is brought back to the most abject time of life, so that, after knowledge, he knoweth naught. And thou (Muhammad) seest the earth barren, but when We send down water thereon, it doth thrill and swell and put forth every lovely kind (of growth). ^qPickthall214


O men, if you are in doubt as to the Uprising, surely We created you of dust then of a sperm-drop, then of a blood clot, then of a lump of flesh, formed and unformed that We may make clear to you. And We establish in the wombs what We will, till a stated term, then We deliver you as infants, then that you may come of age; and some of you die, and some of you are kept back unto the vilest state of life, that after knowing somewhat, they may know nothing. And thou beholdest the earth blackened, then, when We send down water upon it, it quivers, and swells, and puts forth herbs of every joyous kind. ^qArberry214

Zaalika bi annal laaha Huwal haqqu wa annahoo yuhyil mawtaa wa annahoo 'alaakulli shai'in Qadeer ^qTrans215


All this [happens] because God alone is the Ultimate Truth, and because He alone brings the dead to life, and because He has the power to will anything. ^qAsad215


That is because Allah, He is the Truth and because He quickeneth the dead, and because He is Able to do all things; ^qPickthall215


That is because God -- He is the Truth, and brings the dead to life, and is powerful over everything, ^qArberry215

# 7

Wa annas Saa'ata aatiya tul laa raiba feeha wa annal laaha yab'asuman fil quboor ^qTrans216


And [know, O man] that the Last Hour is bound to come, beyond any doubt, and that God will [in­deed] resurrect all who are in their graves. ^qAsad216


And because the Hour will come, there is no doubt thereof; and because Allah will raise those who are in the graves. ^qPickthall216


and because the Hour is coming, no doubt of it, and God shall raise up whosoever is within the tombs. ^qArberry216

# 8

Wa minan naasi mai yujaadilu fil laahi bighairi 'ilminw wa laa hudanw wa laa Kitaabim Muneer ^qTrans217


And yet, among men there is many a one that argues about God without having any knowledge [of Him], without any guidance, and without any light-giving revelation – ^qAsad217


And among mankind is he who disputeth concerning Allah without knowledge or guidance or a scripture giving light, ^qPickthall217


And among men there is such a one that disputes concerning God without knowledge or guidance, or an illuminating Book, ^qArberry217

# 9

Saaniya 'itfihee liyudilla 'an sabeelil laahi lahoo fiddun yaa khizyunw wa nuzeequhoo Yawmal Qiyaamati 'azaabal lhareeq ^qTrans218


scornfully turning aside [from the truth] so as to lead [others] astray from the path of God. Disgrace [of the spirit] is in store for him in this world; and on the Day of Resurrection We shall make him taste suffering through fire; ^qAsad218


Turning away in pride to beguile (men) from the way of Allah. For him in this world is ignominy, and on the Day of Resurrection We make him taste the doom of burning. ^qPickthall218


turning his side to lead astray from God's way; for him is degradation in this world; and on the Resurrection Day We shall let him taste the chastisement of the burning: ^qArberry218

# 10

Zaalika bimaa qaddamat yadaaka wa annal laaha laisa bizallaamil lil'abeed ^qTrans219


[and he shall be told:] “This is an outcome of what thine own hands have wrought - for, never does God do the least wrong to His creatures!” ^qAsad219


(And unto him it will be said): This is for that which thy two hands have sent before, and because Allah is no oppressor of His slaves. ^qPickthall219


'That is for what thy hands have forwarded and for that God is never unjust unto His servants.' ^qArberry219

# 11

Wa minan naasi mai ya'budul laaha 'alaa harfin fa in asaabahoo khairunit maanna bihee wa in asaabat hu fitnatunin qalaba 'alaa wajhihee khasirad dunyaa wal aakhirah; zaalika huwal khusraanul mubeen ^qTrans2110


And there is, too, among men many a one who worships God on the border-line [of faith]: thus, if good befalls him, he is satisfied with Him; but if a trial assails him, he turns away utterly, losing [thereby both] this world and the life to come: [and] this, indeed, is a loss beyond compare! ^qAsad2110


And among mankind is he who worshippeth Allah upon a narrow marge so that if good befalleth him he is content therewith, but if a trial befalleth him, he falleth away utterly. He loseth both the world and the Hereafter. That is the sheer loss. ^qPickthall2110


And among men there is such a one as serves God upon the very edge -- if good befalls him he is at rest in it, but if a trial befalls him he turns completely over; he loses this world and the world to come; that is indeed the manifest loss. ^qArberry2110

# 12

Yad'oo min doonil laahi maa laa yadurruhoo wa maa laa yanfa'uh' zaalika huwad dalaalul ba'ed ^qTrans2111


[By behaving thus,] he invokes, instead of God, something that can neither harm nor benefit him: [and] this is indeed the utmost one can go astray. ^qAsad2111


He calleth, beside Allah, unto that which hurteth him not nor benefiteth him. That is the far error. ^qPickthall2111


He calls, apart from God, upon that which hurts him not, and which neither profits him anything; that is indeed the far error. ^qArberry2111

# 13

Yad'oo laman darruhooo aqrabu min naf'ih; labi'salmawlaa wa labi'sal 'asheer ^qTrans2112


[And sometimes] he invokes [another human being] one that is far more likely to cause harm than benefit: vile, indeed, is such a patron and vile the follower! ^qAsad2112


He calleth unto him whose harm is nearer than his benefit; verily an evil patron and verily an evil friend! ^qPickthall2112


He calls upon him who is likelier to hurt him, rather than to profit him -- an evil protector indeed, he, an evil friend! ^qArberry2112

# 14

Innal laaha yudkhilul laeena aamanoo wa 'amilus saalihaati jannaatin tajree min tahtihal anhaar; innal laaha yaf'alu maa yureed ^qTrans2113


VERILY, God will admit those who have attained to faith and have done righteous deeds into gardens through which running waters flow: for, behold, God does whatever He wills. ^qAsad2113


Lo! Allah causeth those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow. Lo! Allah doth what He intendeth. ^qPickthall2113


God shall surely admit those who believe and do righteous deeds into gardens underneath which rivers flow; surely God does that He desires. ^qArberry2113

# 15

Man kaana yazunnu allai yansurahul laahu fid dunyaa wal aakhirati fal yamdud bisababin ilas samaaa'i summal yaqta' falyanzur hal yuzhibanna kaiduhoo maa yagheez ^qTrans2114


If anyone thinks that God will not succour him in this world and in the life to come, let him reach out unto heaven by any [other] means and [thus try to] make headway: and then let him see whether this scheme of his will indeed do away with the cause of his anguish. ^qAsad2114


Whoso is wont to think (through envy) that Allah will not give him (Muhammad) victory in the world and the Hereafter (and is enraged at the thought of his victory), let him stretch a rope up to the roof (of his dwelling), and let him hang himself. Then let him see whether his strategy dispelleth that whereat he rageth!. ^qPickthall2114


Whosoever thinks God will not help him in the present world and the world to come; let him stretch up a rope to heaven, then let him sever it, and behold whether his guile does away with what enrages him. ^qArberry2114

# 16

Wa kazaalika anzalnaahu aayaatim baiyinaatinw wa annal laaha yahdee mai yureed ^qTrans2115


And thus have We bestowed from on high this [divine writ] in the shape of clear messages: for [thus it is] that God guides him who wills [to be guided]. ^qAsad2115


Thus We reveal it as plain revelations, and verily Allah guideth whom He will. ^qPickthall2115


Even so We have sent it down as signs, clear signs, and for that God guides whom He desires. ^qArberry2115

# 17

Innal lazeena aamanoo wallazeena haadoo was saabi'eena wan nasaaraa wal Majoosa wallazeena ashrakooo innal laaha yafsilu bainahum yawmal qiyaamah; innal laaha 'alaa kulli shai'in shaheed ^qTrans2116


Verily, as for those who have attained to faith [in this divine writ], and those who follow the Jewish faith, and the Sabians, and the Christians, and the Magians, [on the one hand,] and those who are bent on ascribing divinity to aught but God, [on the other,] verily, God will decide between them on Resurrection Day: for, behold, God is witness unto everything. ^qAsad2116


Lo! those who believe (this revelation), and those who are Jews, and the Sabaeans and the Christians and the Magians and the idolaters - Lo! Allah will decide between them on the Day of Resurrection. Lo! Allah is Witness over all things. ^qPickthall2116


Surely they that believe, and those of Jewry, the Sabaeans, the Christians, the Magians and the idolaters -- God shall distinguish between them on the Day of Resurrection; assuredly God is witness over everything. ^qArberry2116

Alam tara annal laaha yasjudu lahoo man fis samaawaati wa man fil ardi wash shamsu walqamaru wan nu joomu wal jibaalu wash shajaru wad dawaaabbu wa kaseerum minan naasi wa kaseerun haqqa 'alaihil 'azaab; wa mai yuhinil laahu famaa lahoo mim mukrim; innallaaha yaf'alu maa yashaaa ^qTrans2117


ART THOU NOT aware that before God prostrate themselves all [things and beings] that are in the heavens and all that are on earth the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and the beasts? And many human beings [submit to God con­sciously], whereas many [others, having defied Him,] will inevitably have to suffer [in the life to come]; and he whom God shall scorn [on Resur­rection Day] will have none who could bestow honour on him: for, verily, God does what He wills. ^qAsad2117


Hast thou not seen that unto Allah payeth adoration whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the hills, and the trees, and the beasts, and many of mankind, while there are many unto whom the doom is justly due. He whom Allah scorneth, there is none to give him honour. Lo! Allah doeth what He will. ^qPickthall2117


Hast thou not seen how to God bow all who are in the and all who are in the earth, heavens the sun and the moon, the stars and the mountains, the trees and the beasts, and many of mankind? And many merit the chastisement; and whom God abases, there is none to honour him. God does whatsoever He will. ^qArberry2117

# 19

Haazaani khasmaanikh tasamoo fee Rabbihim fal lazeena kafaroo qutti'at lahum siyaabum min naar; yusabbu min fawqi ru'oosihimul hameem ^qTrans2118


These two contrary kinds of man have become engrossed in contention about their Sus­tainer! But [thus it is:] as for those who are bent on denying the truth garments of fire shall be cut out for them [in the life to come]; burning despair will be poured over their heads, ^qAsad2118


These twain (the believers and the disbelievers) are two opponents who contend concerning their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, garments of fire will be cut out for them; boiling fluid will be poured down on their heads, ^qPickthall2118


These are two disputants who have disputed concerning their Lord. As for the unbelievers, for them garments of fire shall, be cut, and there shall be poured over their heads boiling water ^qArberry2118

# 20

Yusharu bihee maa fee butoonihim waljulood ^qTrans2119


causing all that is within their bodies, as well as the skins, to melt away. ^qAsad2119


Whereby that which is in their bellies, and their skins too, will be melted; ^qPickthall2119


whereby whatsoever is in their bellies and their skins shall be melted; ^qArberry2119

# 21

Wa lahum maqaami'u min hadeed ^qTrans2120


And they shall be held [in this state as if] by iron grips; ^qAsad2120


And for them are hooked rods of iron. ^qPickthall2120


for them await hooked iron rods; ^qArberry2120

# 22

Kullamaa araadooo any yakhrujoo minhaa min ghammin u'eedoo feeha wa zooqoo 'azaabal hareeq ^qTrans2121


and every time they try in their anguish to come out of it, they shall be returned thereto and [be told]: “Taste suffering through fire [to the full]!” ^qAsad2121


Whenever, in their anguish, they would go forth from thence they are driven back therein and (it is said unto them): Taste the doom of burning. ^qPickthall2121


as often as they desire in their anguish to come forth from it, they shall be restored into it, and: 'Taste the chastisement of the burning!' ^qArberry2121

Innal laaha yudkhilul lazeena aamanoo wa 'amilus saalihaati jannaatin tajree min tahtihal anhaaru yuhallawna feehaa min asaawira min zahabinw wa lu'lu'aa; wa libaasuhum feehaa hareer ^qTrans2122


[As against this,] behold, God will admit those who attain to faith and do righteous deeds into gar­dens through which running waters flow, wherein they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and where silk will be their raiment: ^qAsad2122


Lo! Allah will cause those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will be allowed armlets of gold, and pearls, and their raiment therein will be silk. ^qPickthall2122


God shall surely admit those who believe and do righteous deeds into gardens underneath which rivers flow; therein they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and with pearls, and their apparel there shall be of silk; ^qArberry2122

# 24

Wa hudooo ilat taiyibi minal qawli wa hudooo ilaaa siraatil hameed ^qTrans2123


for they were [willing to be] guided towards the best of all tenets, and so they were guided onto the way that leads to the One unto whom all praise is due. ^qAsad2123


They are guided unto gentle speech; they are guided unto the path of the Glorious One. ^qPickthall2123


and they; shall be guided unto goodly speech, and they shall be guided unto the path of the All-laudable. ^qArberry2123

BEHOLD, as for those who are bent on denying the truth and bar [others] from the path of God and from the Inviolable House of Worship which We have set up for all people alike - [both] those who dwell there and those who come from abroad - and all who seek to profane it by [deliberate] evildoing: [all] such shall We cause to taste grievous suffering in the life to come.] ^qAsad2124


Lo! those who disbelieve and bar (men) from the way of Allah and from the Inviolable Place of Worship, which We have appointed for mankind together, the dweller therein and the nomad: whosoever seeketh wrongful partiality therein, him We shall cause to taste a painful doom. ^qPickthall2124


Those who disbelieve, and bar from God's way and the Holy Mosque that We have appointed equal unto men, alike him who cleaves to it and the tent-dweller, and whosoever purposes to violate it wrongly, We shall let him taste a painful chastisement. ^qArberry2124

Wa iz bawwaanaa li Ibraaheema makaanal Baiti allaa tushrik bee shai'anw wa tahhir Baitiya litaaa'ifeena walqaaa' imeena warrukka 'is sujood ^qTrans2125


For, when We assigned unto Abraham the site of this Temple, [We said unto him:] “Do not ascribe divinity to aught beside Me!” and: “Purify My Temple for those who will walk around it, and those who will stand before it [in meditation], and those who will bow down and prostrate themselves [in prayer].” ^qAsad2125


And (remember) when We prepared for Abraham the place of the (holy) House, saying: Ascribe thou no thing as partner unto Me, and purify My House for those who make the round (thereof) and those who stand and those who bow and make prostration. ^qPickthall2125


And when We settled for Abraham the place of the House: 'Thou shall not associate with Me anything. And do thou purify My House for those that shall go about it and those that stand, for those that bow and prostrate themselves; ^qArberry2125

# 27

Wa azzin fin naasi bil Hajji yaatooka rijaalanw wa 'alaa kulli daamiriny yaateena min kulli fajjin 'ameeq ^qTrans2126


Hence, [O Muhammad,] proclaim thou unto all people the [duty of] pilgrimage: they will come unto thee on foot and on every [kind of] fast mount, coming from every far-away point [on earth], ^qAsad2126


And proclaim unto mankind the pilgrimage. They will come unto thee on foot and on every lean camel; they will come from every deep ravine, ^qPickthall2126


and proclaim among men the Pilgrimage, and they shall come unto thee on foot and upon every lean beast, they shall come from every deep ravine ^qArberry2126

so that they might experience much that shall be of benefit to them, and that they might extol the name of God on the days appointed [for sacrifice], over whatever heads of cattle He may have provided for them [to this end]: eat, then, thereof, and feed the unfortunate poor. ^qAsad2127


That they may witness things that are of benefit to them, and mention the name of Allah on appointed days over the beast of cattle that He hath bestowed upon them. Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor unfortunate. ^qPickthall2127


that they may witness things profitable to them and mention God's Name on days well-known over such beasts of the flocks as He has provided them: "So eat thereof, and feed the wretched poor." ^qArberry2127

# 29

Summal yaqdoo tafasahum wal yoofoo nuzoorahum wal yattawwafoo bil Baitil 'Ateeq ^qTrans2128


Thereafter let them bring to an end their state of self-denial, and let them fulfill the vows which they [may] have made, and let them walk [once again] around the Most Ancient Temple. ^qAsad2128


Then let them make an end of their unkemptness and pay their vows and go around the ancient House. ^qPickthall2128


Let them then finish with their self-neglect and let them fulfil their vows, and go about the Ancient House.' ^qArberry2128

All this [is ordained by God]; and if one houours God’s sacred commandments, it will redound to his own good in his Sustainer’s sight. And all [kinds of] cattle have been made lawful to you [for sacrifice and food], save what is mentioned to you [as forbidden]. Shun, then, [all that God has forbidden and, most of all,] the loathsome evil of idolatrous beliefs and practices; and shun every word that is untrue, ^qAsad2129


That (is the command). And whoso magnifieth the sacred things of Allah, it will be well for him in the sight of his Lord. The cattle are lawful unto you save that which hath been told you. So shun the filth of idols, and shun lying speech, ^qPickthall2129


All that; and whosoever venerates the sacred things of God, it shall be better for him with his Lord. And permitted to you are the flocks, except that which is recited to you. And eschew the abomination of idols, and eschew the speaking of falsehood, ^qArberry2129

Hunafaaa'a lillaahi ghaira mushrikeena bih; wa mai yushrik billaahi faka annamaa kharra minas samaaa'i fatakh tafuhut tairu aw tahwee bihir reehu bee makaanin saheeq ^qTrans2130


[inclining] towards God, [and] turning away from all that is false, without ascribing divine qualities to aught beside Him: for he who ascribes divinity to aught but God is like one who is hurtling down from the skies - whereupon the birds carry him off, or the wind blows him away onto a far-off place. ^qAsad2130


Turning unto Allah (only), not ascribing partners unto Him; for whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah, it is as if he had fallen from the sky and the birds had snatched him or the wind had blown him to a far-off place. ^qPickthall2130


being men pure of faith unto God, not associating with Him anything; for whosoever associates with God anything, it is as though he has fallen from heaven and the birds snatch him away, or the wind sweeps him headlong into a place far away. ^qArberry2130

# 32

Zaalika wa mai yu'azzim sha'aaa'iral laahi fa innahaa min taqwal quloob ^qTrans2131


This is [to be borne in mind]. And anyone who honours the symbols set up by God [shall know that] verily, these [symbols derive their value] from the God-consciousness in the [believers’] hearts. ^qAsad2131


That (is the command). And whoso magnifieth the offerings consecrated to Allah, it surely is from devotion of the hearts, ^qPickthall2131


All that; and whosoever venerates God's waymarks, that is of the godliness of the hearts. ^qArberry2131

# 33

Hence, [O believer,] do not let those [who follow ways other than thine] draw thee into disputes on this score, but summon [them all] unto thy Sustainer: for, behold, thou art indeed on the right way. ^qAsad2166


Unto each nation have We given sacred rites which they are to perform; so let them not dispute with thee of the matter, but summon thou unto thy Lord. Lo! thou indeed followest right guidance. ^qPickthall2166


We have appointed for every nation a holy rite that they shall perform. Let them not therefore wrangle with thee upon the matter, and do thou summon unto thy Lord; surely thou art upon a straight guidance. ^qArberry2166

And if they [try to] argue with thee, say [only]: “God knows best what you are doing.” ^qAsad2167


And if they wrangle with thee, say: Allah is Best Aware of what ye do. ^qPickthall2167


And if they should dispute with thee, do thou say, 'God knows very well what you are doing. ^qArberry2167

Dost thou not know that God knows all that occurs in heaven as well as on earth? All this, behold, is in [God’s] record: verily, [to know] all this is easy for God. ^qAsad2169


Hast thou not known that Allah knoweth all that is in the heaven and the earth? Lo! it is in a record. Lo! that is easy for Allah. ^qPickthall2169

And yet they [who claim to believe in Him often] worship [other beings or forces] beside God - something for which He has never bestoweed any warrant from on high, and [of the reality] whereof they cannot have any knowledge: and such evildoers shall have none to succour them [on Judgment Day]. ^qAsad2170


And they worship instead of Allah that for which He hath sent down no warrant, and that whereof they have no knowledge. For evil-doers there is no helper. ^qPickthall2170


They serve, apart from God, that whereon He has sent down never authority and that whereof they have no knowledge; and for the evildoers there shall be no helper. ^qArberry2170

As it is, whenever Our messages are conveyed unto them in all their clarity, thou canst perceive utter repugnance on the faces of those who are bent on denying the truth: they would almost assault those who convey Our messages unto them! Say: “Shall I, then, tell you of something worse than what you feel at present? It is the fire [of the hereafter] that God has promised to those who are bent on denying the truth: and how vile a journey’s end!” ^qAsad2171


And when Our revelations are recited unto them, thou knowest the denial in the faces of those who disbelieve; they all but attack those who recite Our revelations unto them. Say: Shall I proclaim unto you worse than that? The Fire! Allah hath promised it for those who disbelieve. A hapless journey's end! ^qPickthall2171


And when Our signs are recited to them, clear signs, thou recognisest in the faces of the unbelievers denial; wellnigh they rush upon those who recite to them Our signs. Say: 'Shall I tell you of something worse than that? The Fire -- God has promised it to the unbelievers -- an evil homecoming!' ^qArberry2171

O MEN! A parable is set forth [herewith]; hearken, then, to it! Behold, those beings whom you invoke instead of God cannot create [as much as] a fly, even were they to join all their forces to that end! And if a fly robs them of anything, they cannot [even] rescue it from him! Weak indeed is the seeker, and [weak] the sought! ^qAsad2172


O mankind! A similitude is coined, so pay ye heed to it: Lo! those on whom ye call beside Allah will never create a fly though they combine together for the purpose. And if the fly took something from them, they could not rescue it from it. So weak are (both) the seeker and the sought! ^qPickthall2172


O men, a similitude is struck; so give you ear to it. Surely those upon whom you call, apart from God, shall never create a fly, though they banded together to do it; and if a fly should rob them of aught, they would never rescue it from him. Feeble indeed alike are the seeker and the sought! ^qArberry2172

They measure not Allah His rightful measure. Lo! Allah is Strong, Almighty. ^qPickthall2173


They measure not God with His true measure; surely God is All-strong, All-mighty. ^qArberry2173

Allah chooseth from the angels messengers, and (also) from mankind. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Seer. ^qPickthall2174


God chooses of the angels Messengers and of mankind; surely God is All-hearing, All-seeing. ^qArberry2174

And strive hard in God’s cause with all the striving that is due to Him: it is He who has elected you [to carry His message], and has laid no hardship on you in [anything that pertains to religion, [and made you follow] the creed of your forefather Abraham. It is He who has named you in bygone times as well as in this [divine writ] – “those who have surrendered themselves to God”, so that the Apostle might bear witness to the truth before you, and that you might bear witness to it before all mankind. Thus, be constant in prayer, and render the purifying dues, and hold fast unto God. He is your Lord Supreme: and how excellent is this Lord Supreme, and how excellent this Giver of Succour! ^qAsad2177


And strive for Allah with the endeavour which is His right. He hath chosen you and hath not laid upon you in religion any hardship; the faith of your father Abraham (is yours). He hath named you Muslims of old time and in this (Scripture), that the messenger may be a witness against you, and that ye may be witnesses against mankind. So establish worship, pay the poor-due, and hold fast to Allah. He is your Protecting friend. A blessed Patron and a blessed Helper! ^qPickthall2177


and struggle for God as is His due, for He has chosen you, and has laid on you no impediment in your religion, being the creed of your father Abraham; He named you Muslims aforetime and in this, that the Messenger might be a witness against you, and that you might be witnesses against mankind. So perform the prayer, and pay the alms, and hold you fast to God; He is your Protector -- an excellent Protector, an excellent Helper. ^qArberry2177
