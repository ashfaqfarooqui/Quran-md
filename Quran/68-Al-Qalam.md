# 24

Al laa yadkhulannahal yawma 'alaikum miskeen ^qTrans6824

'No needy man shall enter it today against your will.' ^qArberry6824

# 25

Wa ghadaw 'alaa hardin qaadireen ^qTrans6825


– and early they went, strongly bent upon their purpose. ^qAsad6825


They went betimes, strong in (this) purpose. ^qPickthall6825


And they went forth early, determined upon their purpose. ^qArberry6825

# 26

Falammaa ra awhaa qaalooo innaa ladaaalloon ^qTrans6826


But as soon as they beheld [the garden and could not recognize] it, they exclaimed, "Surely we have lost our way!" ^qAsad6826


But when they saw it, they said: Lo! we are in error! ^qPickthall6826


But when they saw it, they said, 'Surely we are gone astray; ^qArberry6826

# 27

Bal nahnu mahroomoon ^qTrans6827


- [and then,] "Nay, but we have been rendered destitute!" ^qAsad6827


Nay, but we are desolate! ^qPickthall6827


nay, rather we have been robbed!' ^qArberry6827

# 28

Qaala awsatuhum alam aqul lakum law laa tusabbihoon ^qTrans6828


Said the most right-minded among them: "Did I not tell you, 'Will you not extol God's limitless glory?’" ^qAsad6828


The best among them said: Said I not unto you: Why glorify ye not (Allah)? ^qPickthall6828


Said the most moderate of them, 'Did I not say to you, "Why do you not give glory?"' ^qArberry6828

# 29

Qaaloo subhaana rabbinaaa innaa kunnaa zaalimeen ^qTrans6829


They answered: "Limitless in His glory is our Sustainer! Verily, we were doing wrong!" ^qAsad6829


They said: Glorified be our Lord! Lo! we have been wrong-doers. ^qPickthall6829


They said, 'Glory be to God, our Lord; truly, we were evildoers.' ^qArberry6829

# 30

Fa aqbala ba'duhum 'alaa ba'diny yatalaawamoon ^qTrans6830


- and then they turned upon one another with mutual reproaches. ^qAsad6830


Then some of them drew near unto others, self-reproaching. ^qPickthall6830


And they advanced one upon another, blaming each other. ^qArberry6830

# 31

Qaaloo yaa wailanaaa innaa kunnaa taagheen ^qTrans6831


[In the end] they said: "Oh, woe unto us! Verily, we did behave outrageously! ^qAsad6831


They said: Alas for us! In truth we were outrageous. ^qPickthall6831


They said, 'Woe, alas for us! Truly, we were insolent. ^qArberry6831

# 32

'Asaa rabbunaaa any yubdilanaa khairam minhaaa innaaa ilaa rabbinaa raaghiboon ^qTrans6832


[But] it may be that our Sustainer will grant us something better instead: for, verily, unto our Sustainer do we turn with hope!" ^qAsad6832


It may be that our Lord will give us better than this in place thereof. Lo! we beseech our Lord. ^qPickthall6832


It may be that our Lord will give us in exchange a better than it; to our Lord we humbly turn.' ^qArberry6832

# 33

Kazaalikal azaab, wa la'azaabul aakhirati akbar; law kaanoo ya'lamoon ^qTrans6833


SUCH is the suffering [with which We try some people in this world]; but greater by far will be the suffering [which sinners shall have to bear] in the life to come - if they but knew it! ^qAsad6833


Such was the punishment. And verily the punishment of the Hereafter is greater if they did but know. ^qPickthall6833


Such is the chastisement; and the chastisement of the world to come, is assuredly greater, did they but know. ^qArberry6833

# 34

Inna lilmuttaqeena 'inda rabbihim jannaatin na'eem ^qTrans6834


For, behold, it is the God-conscious [alone] whom gardens of bliss await with their Sustainer: ^qAsad6834


Lo! for those who keep from evil are gardens of bliss with their Lord. ^qPickthall6834


Surely for the godfearing shall be Gardens of Bliss with their Lord. ^qArberry6834

# 35

Afanaj'alul muslimeena kalmujrimeen ^qTrans6835


or should We, perchance, treat those who surrender themselves unto Us as [We would treat] those who remain lost in sin? ^qAsad6835


Shall We then treat those who have surrendered as We treat the guilty? ^qPickthall6835


What, shall we make those who have surrendered like to the sinners? ^qArberry6835

# 36

Maa lakum kaifa tahhkumoon ^qTrans6836


What is amiss with you? On what do you base your judgment [of right and wrong]? ^qAsad6836


What aileth you? How foolishly ye judge! ^qPickthall6836


What ails you then, how you judge? ^qArberry6836

# 37

Am lakum kitaabun feehi tadrusoon ^qTrans6837


Or have you, perchance, a [special] divine writ which you study, ^qAsad6837


Or have ye a scripture wherein ye learn ^qPickthall6837


Or have you a Book wherein you study? ^qArberry6837

# 38

Inna lakum feehi lamaa takhaiyaroon ^qTrans6838


and in which you find all that you may wish to find? ^qAsad6838


That ye shall indeed have all that ye choose? ^qPickthall6838


Surely therein you shall have whatever you choose! ^qArberry6838

# 39

Am lakum aymaanun 'alainaa baalighatun ilaa yawmil qiyaamati inna lakum lamaa tahkumoon ^qTrans6839


Or have you received a solemn promise, binding on Us till Resurrection Day, that yours will assuredly be whatever you judge [to be your rightful due]? ^qAsad6839


Or have ye a covenant on oath from Us that reacheth to the Day of Judgment, that yours shall be all that ye ordain? ^qPickthall6839


Or have you oaths from Us, reaching to the Day of Resurrection? Surely you shall have whatever you judge! ^qArberry6839

# 40

Salhum ayyuhum bizaa lika za'eem ^qTrans6840


Ask them which of them is able to vouch for this! ^qAsad6840


Ask them (O Muhammad) which of them will vouch for that! ^qPickthall6840


Ask them, which of them will guarantee that! ^qArberry6840

# 41

Am lahum shurakaaa'u falyaatoo bishurakaaa 'ihim in kaanoo saadiqeen ^qTrans6841


Or have they, perchance, any sages to support their views? Well, then, if they are sincere in this their claim, let them produce those supporters of theirs ^qAsad6841


Or have they other gods? Then let them bring their other gods if they are truthful ^qPickthall6841


Or do they have associates? Then let them bring their associates, if they speak truly. ^qArberry6841

# 42

Yawma yukshafu 'am saaqinw wa yud'awna ilas sujoodi falaa yastatee'oon ^qTrans6842


on the Day when man's very being shall be bared to the bone, and when they [who now deny the truth] shall be called upon to prostrate themselves [before God], and shall be unable to do so: ^qAsad6842


On the day when it befalleth in earnest, and they are ordered to prostrate themselves but are not able, ^qPickthall6842


Upon the day when the leg shall be bared, and they shall be summoned to bow themselves, but they cannot; ^qArberry6842

# 43

Khaashi'atan absaaruhum tarhaquhum zillatunw wa qad kaanoo yud'awna ilassujoodi wa hum saalimoon ^qTrans6843


downcast will be their eyes, with ignominy overwhelming them - seeing that they had been called upon [in vain] to prostrate themselves [before Him] while they were yet sound [and alive]. ^qAsad6843


With eyes downcast, abasement stupefying them. And they had been summoned to prostrate themselves while they were yet unhurt. ^qPickthall6843


humbled shall be their eyes, and abasement shall overspread them, for they had been summoned to bow themselves while they were whole. ^qArberry6843

# 44

Fazarnee wa many yukazzibu bihaazal hadeesi sanastad rijuhum min haisu laa ya'lamoon ^qTrans6844


Hence, leave Me alone with such as give the lie to this tiding. We shall bring them low, step by step, without their perceiving how it has come about: ^qAsad6844


Leave Me (to deal) with those who give the lie to this pronouncement. We shall lead them on by steps from whence they know not. ^qPickthall6844


So leave Me with him who cries lies to this discourse! We will draw them on little by little whence they know not; ^qArberry6844

# 45

Wa umlee lahum; inna kaidee mateen ^qTrans6845


for, behold, though I may give them rein for a while, My subtle scheme is exceedingly firm! ^qAsad6845


Yet I bear with them, for lo! My scheme is firm. ^qPickthall6845


and I shall respite them -- assuredly My guile is sure. ^qArberry6845

# 46

Am tas'aluhum ajran fahum mim maghramim musqaloon ^qTrans6846


Or is it that [they fear lest] thou ask them for a reward, [O Prophet,] so that they would be burdened with debt [if they listened to thee]? ^qAsad6846


Or dost thou (Muhammad) ask a fee from them so that they are heavily taxed? ^qPickthall6846


Or askest thou them for a wage, and so they are weighed down with debt? ^qArberry6846

# 47

Am 'indahumul ghaibu fahum yaktuboon ^qTrans6847


Or [do they think] that the hidden reality [of all that exists] is within their grasp, so that [in time] they can write it down? ^qAsad6847


Or is the Unseen theirs that they can write (thereof)? ^qPickthall6847


Or is the Unseen in their keeping, and so they are writing it down? ^qArberry6847

# 48

Fasbir lihkmi rabbika wa laa takun kasaahibil boot; iz naadaa wa huwa makzoom ^qTrans6848


BEAR THEN with patience thy Sustainer's will and be not like him of the great fish, who cried out [in distress] after having given in to anger. ^qAsad6848


But wait thou for thy Lord's decree, and be not like him of the fish, who cried out in despair. ^qPickthall6848


So be thou patient under the judgment of thy Lord, and be not as the Man of the Fish, when he called, choking inwardly. ^qArberry6848

# 49

Law laaa an tadaara kahoo ni'matum mir rabbihee lanubiza bil'araaa'i wa huwa mazmoom ^qTrans6849


[And remember:] had not grace from his Sustainer reached him, he would indeed have been cast forth upon that barren shore in a state of disgrace: ^qAsad6849


Had it not been that favour from his Lord had reached him he surely had been cast into the wilderness while he was reprobate. ^qPickthall6849


Had there not overtaken him a blessing from his Lord he would have been cast upon the wilderness, being condemned. ^qArberry6849

# 50

Fajtabaahu rabbuhoo faja'alahoo minas saaliheen ^qTrans6850


but [as it was,] his Sustainer had elected him and placed him among the righteous. ^qAsad6850


But his Lord chose him and placed him among the righteous. ^qPickthall6850


But his Lord had chosen him, and He placed him among the righteous. ^qArberry6850

# 51

Wa iny-yakaadul lazeena kafaroo la-yuzliqoonaka biabsaarihim lammaa saml'uz-Zikra wa yaqooloona innahoo lamajnoon ^qTrans6851


Hence, [be patient,] even though they who are bent on denying the truth would all but kill thee with their eyes whenever they hear this reminder, and [though] they say, "[As for Muhammad,] behold, most surely he is a madman!" ^qAsad6851


And lo! those who disbelieve would fain disconcert thee with their eyes when they hear the Reminder, and they say: Lo! he is indeed mad; ^qPickthall6851


The unbelievers wellnigh strike thee down with their glances, when they hear the Reminder, and they say, 'Surely he is a man possessed!' ^qArberry6851

# 52

Wa maa huwa illaa zikrul lil'aalameen ^qTrans6852


[Be patient:] for this is nought else but a reminder [from God] to all mankind. ^qAsad6852


When it is naught else than a Reminder to creation. ^qPickthall6852


And it is nothing but a Reminder unto all beings. ^qArberry6852
