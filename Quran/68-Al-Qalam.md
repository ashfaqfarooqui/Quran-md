# 32

'Asaa rabbunaaa any yubdilanaa khairam minhaaa innaaa ilaa rabbinaa raaghiboon ^qTrans6731


[But] it may be that our Sustainer will grant us something better instead: for, verily, unto our Sustainer do we turn with hope!" ^qAsad6731


It may be that our Lord will give us better than this in place thereof. Lo! we beseech our Lord. ^qPickthall6731

Kazaalikal azaab, wa la'azaabul aakhirati akbar; law kaanoo ya'lamoon ^qTrans6732


SUCH is the suffering [with which We try some people in this world]; but greater by far will be the suffering [which sinners shall have to bear] in the life to come - if they but knew it! ^qAsad6732


Such was the punishment. And verily the punishment of the Hereafter is greater if they did but know. ^qPickthall6732


Such is the chastisement; and the chastisement of the world to come, is assuredly greater, did they but know. ^qArberry6732

# 34

Inna lilmuttaqeena 'inda rabbihim jannaatin na'eem ^qTrans6733


For, behold, it is the God-conscious [alone] whom gardens of bliss await with their Sustainer: ^qAsad6733

Surely for the godfearing shall be Gardens of Bliss with their Lord. ^qArberry6733

# 35

Afanaj'alul muslimeena kalmujrimeen ^qTrans6734


or should We, perchance, treat those who surrender themselves unto Us as [We would treat] those who remain lost in sin? ^qAsad6734


Shall We then treat those who have surrendered as We treat the guilty? ^qPickthall6734


What, shall we make those who have surrendered like to the sinners? ^qArberry6734

# 36

Maa lakum kaifa tahhkumoon ^qTrans6735


What is amiss with you? On what do you base your judgment [of right and wrong]? ^qAsad6735


What aileth you? How foolishly ye judge! ^qPickthall6735


What ails you then, how you judge? ^qArberry6735

# 37

Am lakum kitaabun feehi tadrusoon ^qTrans6736


Or have you, perchance, a [special] divine writ which you study, ^qAsad6736

Or have you a Book wherein you study? ^qArberry6736

# 38

Inna lakum feehi lamaa takhaiyaroon ^qTrans6737


and in which you find all that you may wish to find? ^qAsad6737


That ye shall indeed have all that ye choose? ^qPickthall6737


Surely therein you shall have whatever you choose! ^qArberry6737

# 39

Am lakum aymaanun 'alainaa baalighatun ilaa yawmil qiyaamati inna lakum lamaa tahkumoon ^qTrans6738


Or have you received a solemn promise, binding on Us till Resurrection Day, that yours will assuredly be whatever you judge [to be your rightful due]? ^qAsad6738

Or have you oaths from Us, reaching to the Day of Resurrection? Surely you shall have whatever you judge! ^qArberry6738

# 41

Am lahum shurakaaa'u falyaatoo bishurakaaa 'ihim in kaanoo saadiqeen ^qTrans6740


Or have they, perchance, any sages to support their views? Well, then, if they are sincere in this their claim, let them produce those supporters of theirs ^qAsad6740


Or have they other gods? Then let them bring their other gods if they are truthful ^qPickthall6740


Or do they have associates? Then let them bring their associates, if they speak truly. ^qArberry6740

# 42

Yawma yukshafu 'am saaqinw wa yud'awna ilas sujoodi falaa yastatee'oon ^qTrans6741


on the Day when man's very being shall be bared to the bone, and when they [who now deny the truth] shall be called upon to prostrate themselves [before God], and shall be unable to do so: ^qAsad6741


On the day when it befalleth in earnest, and they are ordered to prostrate themselves but are not able, ^qPickthall6741


Upon the day when the leg shall be bared, and they shall be summoned to bow themselves, but they cannot; ^qArberry6741

# 43

Khaashi'atan absaaruhum tarhaquhum zillatunw wa qad kaanoo yud'awna ilassujoodi wa hum saalimoon ^qTrans6742


downcast will be their eyes, with ignominy overwhelming them - seeing that they had been called upon [in vain] to prostrate themselves [before Him] while they were yet sound [and alive]. ^qAsad6742


With eyes downcast, abasement stupefying them. And they had been summoned to prostrate themselves while they were yet unhurt. ^qPickthall6742


humbled shall be their eyes, and abasement shall overspread them, for they had been summoned to bow themselves while they were whole. ^qArberry6742

# 44

Fazarnee wa many yukazzibu bihaazal hadeesi sanastad rijuhum min haisu laa ya'lamoon ^qTrans6743


Hence, leave Me alone with such as give the lie to this tiding. We shall bring them low, step by step, without their perceiving how it has come about: ^qAsad6743


Leave Me (to deal) with those who give the lie to this pronouncement. We shall lead them on by steps from whence they know not. ^qPickthall6743


So leave Me with him who cries lies to this discourse! We will draw them on little by little whence they know not; ^qArberry6743

# 45

Wa umlee lahum; inna kaidee mateen ^qTrans6744


for, behold, though I may give them rein for a while, My subtle scheme is exceedingly firm! ^qAsad6744


Yet I bear with them, for lo! My scheme is firm. ^qPickthall6744


and I shall respite them -- assuredly My guile is sure. ^qArberry6744

# 46

Am tas'aluhum ajran fahum mim maghramim musqaloon ^qTrans6745


Or is it that [they fear lest] thou ask them for a reward, [O Prophet,] so that they would be burdened with debt [if they listened to thee]? ^qAsad6745


Or dost thou (Muhammad) ask a fee from them so that they are heavily taxed? ^qPickthall6745


Or askest thou them for a wage, and so they are weighed down with debt? ^qArberry6745

# 47

Am 'indahumul ghaibu fahum yaktuboon ^qTrans6746


Or [do they think] that the hidden reality [of all that exists] is within their grasp, so that [in time] they can write it down? ^qAsad6746


Or is the Unseen theirs that they can write (thereof)? ^qPickthall6746


Or is the Unseen in their keeping, and so they are writing it down? ^qArberry6746

# 48

Fasbir lihkmi rabbika wa laa takun kasaahibil boot; iz naadaa wa huwa makzoom ^qTrans6747


BEAR THEN with patience thy Sustainer's will and be not like him of the great fish, who cried out [in distress] after having given in to anger. ^qAsad6747


But wait thou for thy Lord's decree, and be not like him of the fish, who cried out in despair. ^qPickthall6747


So be thou patient under the judgment of thy Lord, and be not as the Man of the Fish, when he called, choking inwardly. ^qArberry6747

# 49

Law laaa an tadaara kahoo ni'matum mir rabbihee lanubiza bil'araaa'i wa huwa mazmoom ^qTrans6748


[And remember:] had not grace from his Sustainer reached him, he would indeed have been cast forth upon that barren shore in a state of disgrace: ^qAsad6748


Had it not been that favour from his Lord had reached him he surely had been cast into the wilderness while he was reprobate. ^qPickthall6748


Had there not overtaken him a blessing from his Lord he would have been cast upon the wilderness, being condemned. ^qArberry6748

# 50

Fajtabaahu rabbuhoo faja'alahoo minas saaliheen ^qTrans6749


but [as it was,] his Sustainer had elected him and placed him among the righteous. ^qAsad6749


But his Lord chose him and placed him among the righteous. ^qPickthall6749


But his Lord had chosen him, and He placed him among the righteous. ^qArberry6749

# 51

Wa iny-yakaadul lazeena kafaroo la-yuzliqoonaka biabsaarihim lammaa saml'uz-Zikra wa yaqooloona innahoo lamajnoon ^qTrans6750


Hence, [be patient,] even though they who are bent on denying the truth would all but kill thee with their eyes whenever they hear this reminder, and [though] they say, "[As for Muhammad,] behold, most surely he is a madman!" ^qAsad6750


And lo! those who disbelieve would fain disconcert thee with their eyes when they hear the Reminder, and they say: Lo! he is indeed mad; ^qPickthall6750


The unbelievers wellnigh strike thee down with their glances, when they hear the Reminder, and they say, 'Surely he is a man possessed!' ^qArberry6750

# 52

Wa maa huwa illaa zikrul lil'aalameen ^qTrans6751


[Be patient:] for this is nought else but a reminder [from God] to all mankind. ^qAsad6751


When it is naught else than a Reminder to creation. ^qPickthall6751


And it is nothing but a Reminder unto all beings. ^qArberry6751
