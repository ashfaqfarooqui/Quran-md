Ahasiban naasu anyu yutrakooo any yaqoolooo aamannaa wa hum la yuftanoon ^qTrans292


DO MEN THINK that on their [mere] saying, “We have attained to faith”, they will be left to themselves, and will not be put to a test? ^qAsad292


Do men imagine that they will be left (at ease) because they say, We believe, and will not be tested with affliction? ^qPickthall292


Do the people reckon that they will be left to say 'We believe,' and will not be tried? ^qArberry292

Wa laqad fatannal lazeena min qablihim fala ya'lamannal laahul lazeena sadaqoo wa la ya'lamannal kaazibeen ^qTrans293


Yea, indeed, We did test those who lived before them; and so, [too, shall be tested the people now living: and] most certainly will God mark out those who prove themselves true, and most certainly will He mark out those who are lying. ^qAsad293


Lo! We tested those who were before you. Thus Allah knoweth those who are sincere, and knoweth those who feign. ^qPickthall293


We certainly tried those that were before them, and assuredly God knows those who speak truly, and assuredly He knows the liars. ^qArberry293

Am hasibal lazeena ya'maloonas sayyiaati any yasbiqoonaa; saaa'a maa yahkumoon ^qTrans294


Or do they think - they who do evil deeds [while claiming to have attained to faith] - that they can escape Us? Bad, indeed, is their judgment! ^qAsad294


Or do those who do ill-deeds imagine that they can outstrip Us? Evil (for them) is that which they decide. ^qPickthall294


Or do they reckon, those who do evil deeds, that they will outstrip Us? Ill they judge! ^qArberry294

Man kaana yarjoo liqaaa 'allaahi fa inna ajalal laahi laaat; wa Huwass Sameeul 'Aleem ^qTrans295


Whoever looks forward [with hope and awe] to meeting God [on Resurrection Day, let him be ready for it]: for, behold, the end set by God [for every­one’s life] is bound to come - and He alone is all-hearing, all-knowing! ^qAsad295


Whoso looketh forward to the meeting with Allah (let him know that) Allah's reckoning is surely nigh, and He is the Hearer, the Knower. ^qPickthall295


Whoso looks to encounter God, God's term is coming; He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing. ^qArberry295

Wa man jaahada fainnamaa yujaahidu linafsih; innal laaha laghaniyyun 'anil 'aalameen ^qTrans296


Hence, whoever strives hard [in God’s cause] does so only for his own good: for, verily, God does not stand in need of anything in all the worlds! ^qAsad296


And whosoever striveth, striveth only for himself, for lo! Allah is altogether Independent of (His) creatures. ^qPickthall296


Whosoever struggles, struggles only to his own gain; surely God is All-sufficient nor needs any being. ^qArberry296

Wallazeena aamanoo wa 'amilus saalihaati lanukaf firanna 'anhum saiyiaatihim wa lanajziyannahum ahsanal lazee kaanoo ya'maloon ^qTrans297


And as for those who attain to faith and do righteous deeds, We shall most certainly efface their [previous] bad deeds, and shall most certainly reward them in accordance with the best that they ever did. ^qAsad297


And as for those who believe and do good works, We shall remit from them their evil deeds and shall repay them the best that they did. ^qPickthall297


And those who believe, and do righteous deeds, We shall surely acquit them of their evil deeds, and shall recompense them the best of what they were doing. ^qArberry297

Wa wassainal insaana biwaalidaihi husnanw wa in jaahadaaka litushrika bee maa laisa laka bihee 'ilmun falaa tuti'humaa; ilaiya marji'ukum fa unabbi'ukum bimaa kuntum ta'maloon ^qTrans298


Now [among the best of righteous deeds which] We have enjoined upon man [is] goodness towards his parents; yet [even so,] should they endeavour to make thee ascribe divinity, side by side with Me, to something which thy mind cannot accept [as divine], obey then, not: [for] it is unto Me that you all must return, whereupon I shall make you [truly] understand [the right and wrong of] all that you were doing [in life]. ^qAsad298


We have enjoined on man kindness to parents; but if they strive to make thee join with Me that of which thou hast no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return and I shall tell you what ye used to do. ^qPickthall298


We have charged man, that he be kind to his parents; but if they strive with thee to make thee associate with Me that whereof thou hast no knowledge, then do not obey them; unto Me you shall return, and I shall tell you what you were doing. ^qArberry298

# 9

Wallazeena aamanoo w a'amilus saalihaati lanudkhilan nahum fis saaliheen ^qTrans299


But as for those who have attained to faith and have done righteous deeds, We shall most certainly cause them to join the righteous [in the hereafter as well]. ^qAsad299


And as for those who believe and do good works, We verily shall make them enter in among the righteous. ^qPickthall299


And those who believe, and do righteous deeds assuredly We shall admit them among the righteous. ^qArberry299

Wa minan naasi many yaqoolu aamannaa billaahi faizaaa ooziya fil laahi ja'ala fitnatan naasi ka'azaabil laahi wa la'in jaaa'a nasrum mir Rabbika la yaqoolunna innaa kunnaa ma'akum; awa laisal laahu bi a'lama bimaa fee surdooril 'aalameen ^qTrans2910


Now there is among men many a one who says [of himself and of others like him], “We do believe in God” - but whenever he is made to suffer in God’s cause, he thinks that persecution at the hands of man is as [much to be feared, or even more than,] God’s chastisement; whereas, if succour from thy Sustainer comes [to those who truly believe] he is sure to say. “Behold, we have always been with you!” Is not God fully aware of what is in the hearts of all creatures? ^qAsad2910


Of mankind is he who saith: We believe in Allah, but, if he be made to suffer for the sake of Allah, he mistaketh the persecution of mankind for Allah's punishment; and then, if victory cometh from thy Lord, will say: Lo! we were with you (all the while). Is not Allah Best Aware of what is in the bosoms of (His) creatures? ^qPickthall2910


Some men there are who say, 'We believe in God,' but when such a man is hurt in God's cause, he makes the persecution of men as it were God's chastisement; then if help comes from thy Lord, he will say 'We were with you.' What, does not God know very well what is in the breasts of all beings? ^qArberry2910

# 11

Wa la ya'lamannal laahul lazeena aamanoo wa la ya'lamannal munaafiqeen ^qTrans2911


[Yea-] and most certainly will God mark out those who have [truly] attained to faith, and most certainly will He mark out the hypocrites. ^qAsad2911


Verily Allah knoweth those who believe, and verily He knoweth the hypocrites. ^qPickthall2911


God surely knows the believers, and He knows the hypocrites. ^qArberry2911

Wa qaalal lazaeena kafaroo lillazeena aamanut tabi'oo sabeelanaa walnahmil khataayaakum wa maa hum bihaamileena min khataa yaahum min shai'in innahum lakaaziboon ^qTrans2912


And [He is aware, too, that] they who are bent on denying the truth speak [thus, as it were,] to those who have attained to faith: “Follow our way [of life], and we shall indeed take your sins upon ourselves!” But never could they take upon themselves aught of the sins of those [whom they would thus mislead]: behold, they are liars indeed! ^qAsad2912


Those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Follow our way (of religion) and we verily will bear your sins (for you). They cannot bear aught of their sins. Lo! they verily are liars. ^qPickthall2912


The unbelievers say to the believers, 'Follow our path, and let us carry your offences'; yet they cannot carry anything, even of their own offences; they are truly liars. ^qArberry2912

# 13

Wa la yahmilunna asqaa lahum wa asqaalam ma'a asqaalihim wa la yus'alunna Yawmal Qiyaamati 'ammaa kaanoo yaftaroon ^qTrans2913


Yet most certainly will they have to bear their own burdens, and other burdens besides their own; and most certainly will they be called to account on Resurrection Day for all their false assertions! ^qAsad2913


But they verily will bear their own loads and other loads beside their own, and they verily will be questioned on the Day of Resurrection concerning that which they invented. ^qPickthall2913


They shall certainly carry their loads, and other loads along with their loads, and upon the Day of Resurrection they shall surely be questioned concerning that they were forging. ^qArberry2913

Wa laqad arsalnaa Noohan ilaa qawmihee falabisa feehim alfa sanatin illaa khamseena 'aaman fa akhazahumut toofaanu wa hum zaalimoon ^qTrans2914


And, indeed, [in times long past] We sent forth Noah unto his people, and he dwelt among them a thousand years bar fifty; and then the floods over­whelmed them while they were still lost in evildoing: ^qAsad2914


And verily we sent Noah (as Our messenger) unto his folk, and he continued with them for a thousand years save fifty years; and the flood engulfed them, for they were wrong-doers. ^qPickthall2914


Indeed, We sent Noah to his people, and he tarried among them a thousand years, all but fifty; so the Flood seized them, while they were evildoers. ^qArberry2914

# 15

Fa anjainaahu wa as haabas safeenati wa ja'alnaahaaa Aayatal lil'aalameen ^qTrans2915


but We saved him, together with all who were in the ark, which We then set up as a symbol [of Our grace] for all people [to remember]. ^qAsad2915


And We rescued him and those with him in the ship, and made of it a portent for the peoples. ^qPickthall2915


Yet We delivered him, and those who were in the ship, and appointed it for a sign unto all beings. ^qArberry2915

# 16

Wa Ibraheema iz qaala liqawmihi' budul laaha wattaqoohu zaalikum khayrul lakum in kuntum ta'lamoon ^qTrans2916


And Abraham, [too, was inspired by Us] when he said unto his people: “Worship God, and be conscious of Him: this is the best for you, if you but knew it! ^qAsad2916


And Abraham! (Remember) when he said unto his folk: Serve Allah, and keep your duty unto Him; that is better for you if ye did but know. ^qPickthall2916


And Abraham, when he said to his people, 'Serve God, and fear Him; that is better for you, did you know. ^qArberry2916

Innamaa ta'ubdoona min doonil laahi awsaananw-wa takhluqoona ifkaa; innal lazeena ta'budoona min doonil laahi laa yamlikoona lakum rizqan fabtaghoo 'indal laahir rizqa fabtaghoo 'indal laahir rizqa wa'budoohu washkuroo lahooo ilaihi turja'oon ^qTrans2917


You worship only [lifeless] idols instead of God, and [thus] you give visible shape to a lie! Behold, those [things and beings] that you worship instead of God have it not in their power to provide sustenance for you: seek, then, all [your] sustenance from God, and worship Him [alone] and be grateful to Him: [for] unto Him you shall be brought back! ^qAsad2917


Ye serve instead of Allah only idols, and ye only invent a lie. Lo! those whom ye serve instead of Allah own no provision for you. So seek your provision from Allah, and serve Him, and give thanks unto Him, (for) unto Him ye will be brought back. ^qPickthall2917


You only serve, apart from God, idols and you create a calumny; those you serve, apart from God, have no power to provide for you. So seek after your provision with God, and serve Him, and be thankful to Him; unto Him you shall be returned. ^qArberry2917

# 18

Wa in tukazziboo faqad kazzaba umamum min qablikum wa maa'alar Rasooli illal balaaghul mubeen ^qTrans2918


“And if you give [me] the lie - well, [other] communities have given the lie [to Gods prophets] before your time: but no more is an apostle bound to do than clearly deliver the message [entrusted to him].” ^qAsad2918


But if ye deny, then nations have denied before you. The messenger is only to convey (the message) plainly. ^qPickthall2918


'But if you cry me lies, nations cried lies before you; and it is only for the Messenger to deliver the Manifest Message.' ^qArberry2918

# 19

Awa lam yaraw kaifa yubdi'ul laahul khalqa summa yu'eeduh; inna zaalika 'alal laahi yaseer ^qTrans2919


Are then they [who deny the truth] not aware of how God creates [life] in the first instance, and then brings it forth anew? This, verily, is easy for God! ^qAsad2919


See they not how Allah produceth creation, then reproduceth it? Lo! for Allah that is easy. ^qPickthall2919


(Have they not seen how God originates creation, then brings it back again? Surely that is an easy matter for God. ^qArberry2919

# 20

Qul seeroo fil ardi fanzuroo kaifa baa al khalqa summal laahu yunshi''un nash atal Aakhirah; innal laaha 'alaa kulli shai'in Qadeer ^qTrans2920


Say: “Go all over the earth and behold how [wondrously] He has created [man] in the first in­stance: and thus, too, will God bring into being your second life for, verily, God has the power to will anything! ^qAsad2920


Say (O Muhammad): Travel in the land and see how He originated creation, then Allah bringeth forth the later growth. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things. ^qPickthall2920


Say: Journey in the land, then behold how He originated creation; then God causes the second growth to grow; God is powerful over everything, ^qArberry2920

# 21

Yu'azzibu many yashaaa'u wa yarhamu many yashaaa'; wa ilaihi tuqlaboon ^qTrans2921


He causes to suffer whomever He wills, and bestows His mercy on whomever He wills; and unto Him you shall be made to return: ^qAsad2921


He punisheth whom He will and showeth mercy unto whom He will, and unto Him ye will be turned. ^qPickthall2921


chastising whom He will, and having mercy on whomsoever He will, and unto Him you shall be turned. ^qArberry2921

# 22

Wa maaa antum bimu'jizeena fil ardi wa laa fissamaaa'i wa maa lakum min doonil laahi minw waliyyinw wa laa naseer ^qTrans2922


and never - not on earth and not in the skies - can you [hope to] elude Him: and you have none to protect you from God, and none to bring you succour.” ^qAsad2922


Ye cannot escape (from Him) in the earth or in the sky, and beside Allah there is for you no friend or helper. ^qPickthall2922


You are not able to frustrate Him either in the earth or in heaven; and you have not, apart from God, either protector or helper. ^qArberry2922

# 23

Wallazeena kafaroo bi Aayaatil laahi wa liqaaa'iheee ulaaa'ika ya'isoo mir rahmatee wa ulaaa'ika lahum 'azaabun aleem ^qTrans2923


And [thus it is:] they who are bent on denying the truth of God’s messages and of their [ultimate] meeting with Him - it is they who abandon all hope of My grace and mercy: and it is they whom grievous suffering awaits [in the life to come]. ^qAsad2923


Those who disbelieve in the revelations of Allah and in (their) Meeting with Him, such have no hope of My mercy. For such there is a painful doom. ^qPickthall2923


And those who disbelieve in God's signs and the encounter with Him -- they despair of My mercy, and there awaits them a painful chastisement.) ^qArberry2923

# 24

Famaa kaana jawaaba qawmiheee illaaa an qaaluqtuloohu aw harriqoohu faanjaahul laahu minan naar; inna fee zaalika la Aayaatil laqawminy yu'minoon ^qTrans2924


Now [as for Abraham,] his people’s only answer was, “Slay him, or burn him!” – but God saved him from the fire. Behold, in this [story] there are messages indeed for people who will believe! ^qAsad2924


But the answer of his folk was only that they said: "Kill him" or "Burn him." Then Allah saved him from the Fire. Lo! herein verily are portents for folk who believe. ^qPickthall2924


But the only answer of his people was that they said, 'Slay him, or burn him!' Then God delivered him from the fire; surely in that are signs for a people who believe. ^qArberry2924

Wa qaala innamat takhaz tum min doonil laahi awsaanam mawaddata bainikum fil hayaatid dunyaa summa yawmal qiyaamati yakfuru ba'dukum biba 'dinw wa yal'anu ba'dukum ba'danw-wa yal'anu ba'dukum ba'danw wa maa waakumun Naaru wa maa lakum min naasireen ^qTrans2925


And [Abraham] said: “You have chosen to worship idols instead of God for no other reason than to have a bond of love in the life of this world, between yourselves [and your forebears]: but then, on Resurrection Day, you shall disown one another and curse one another - for the goal of you all will be the fire, and you will have none to succour you. ^qAsad2925


He said: Ye have chosen only idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of the world. Then on the Day of Resurrection ye will deny each other and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and ye will have no helpers. ^qPickthall2925


And he said, 'You have only taken to yourselves idols, apart from God, as a mark of mutual love between you in the present life; then upon the Day of Resurrection you will deny one another, and you will curse one another, and your refuge will be the Fire, and you will have no helpers.' ^qArberry2925

# 26

Fa aamana lahoo Loot; wa qaala innee mauhajirun ilaa Rabbee innahoo Huwal 'Azeezul Hakeem ^qTrans2926


Thereupon [his brother’s son] Lot came to believe in him and said: “Verily, I [too] shall forsake the domain of evil [and turn] to my Sustainer: for, verily, He alone is almighty, truly wise!” ^qAsad2926


And Lot believed him, and said: Lo! I am a fugitive unto my Lord. Lo! He, only He, is the Mighty, the Wise. ^qPickthall2926


But Lot believed him; and he said, 'I will flee to my Lord; He is the All-mighty, the All-wise.' ^qArberry2926

And [as for Abraham,] We bestowed upon him Isaac and [Isaac’s son] Jacob, and caused pro­phethood and revelation to continue among his offspring. And We vouchsafed him his reward in this world; and, verily, in the life to come [too] he shall find himself among the righteous. ^qAsad2927


And We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and We established the prophethood and the Scripture among his seed, and We gave him his reward in the world, and lo! in the Hereafter he verily is among the righteous. ^qPickthall2927


And We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and We appointed the Prophecy and the Book to be among his seed; We gave him his wage in this world, and in the world to come he shall be among the righteous. ^qArberry2927

# 28

Wa Lootan iz qaala liqawmiheee innakum laatoonal faahishata maa sabaqakum bihaa min ahadim minal 'aalameen ^qTrans2928


And Lot, [too, was inspired by Us] when he said unto his people: “Verily, you commit abominations such as none in all the world has ever committed before you! ^qAsad2928


And Lot! (Remember) when he said unto his folk: Lo! ye commit lewdness such as no creature did before you. ^qPickthall2928


And Lot, when he said to his people 'Surely you commit such indecency as never any being in all the world committed before you. ^qArberry2928

Must you indeed approach men [with lust], and thus cut across the way [of nature]? and must you commit these shameful deeds in your open] assemblies?” But his people’s only answer was, “Bring down upon us God’s chastisement, if thou art a man of truth!” ^qAsad2929


For come ye not in unto males, and cut ye not the road (for travellers), and commit ye not abomination in your meetings? But the answer of his folk was only that they said: Bring Allah's doom upon us if thou art a truthteller! ^qPickthall2929


What, do you approach men, and cut the way, and commit in your assembly dishonour?' But the only answer of his people was that they said, 'Then bring us the chastisement of God, if thou speakest truly.' ^qArberry2929

# 30

Qaala Rabbin surnee 'alal qawmil mufsideen ^qTrans2930


[And] he prayed: “O my Sustainer! Succour Thou me against these people who spread corrup­tion!” ^qAsad2930


He said: My Lord! Give me victory over folk who work corruption. ^qPickthall2930


He said, 'My Lord, help me against the people that work corruption.' ^qArberry2930

Wa lammaa jaaa'at Rusulunaaa Ibraaheema bil bushraa qaalooo innaa muhlikoo ahli haazihil qaryati inna ahlahaa kaanoo zaalimeen ^qTrans2931


And so, when Our [heavenly] messengers came to Abraham with the glad tiding [of the birth of Isaac], they [also] said, “Behold, we are about to destroy the people of that land, for its people are truly evildoers!” ^qAsad2931


And when Our messengers brought Abraham the good news, they said: Lo! we are about to destroy the people of that township, for its people are wrong-doers. ^qPickthall2931

[And when Abraham] exclaimed, “But Lot lives there!” - they answered: We know fully well who is there; most certainly we shall save him and his household - all but his wife: she will indeed be among those that stay behind.” ^qAsad2932


He said: Lo! Lot is there. They said: We are best aware of who is there. We are to deliver him and his household, all save his wife, who is of those who stay behind. ^qPickthall2932


He said, 'Lot is in it.' They said, 'We know very well who is in it; assuredly We shall deliver him and his family, except his wife; she has become of those that tarry.' ^qArberry2932

And when Our messengers came unto Lot, he was sorely grieved on their account, seeing that it was beyond his power to shield them; but they said: “Fear not, and grieve not! Behold, we shall save thee and thy household - all but thy wife: she will indeed be among those that stay behind. ^qAsad2933


And when Our messengers came unto Lot, he was troubled upon their account, for he could not protect them; but they said: Fear not, nor grieve! Lo! we are to deliver thee and thy household, (all) save thy wife, who is of those who stay behind. ^qPickthall2933


When that Our messengers came to Lot he was troubled on their account and distressed for them; but they said, 'Fear not, neither sorrow, for surely we shall deliver thee and thy family, except thy wife; she has become of those that tarry. ^qArberry2933

Lo! We are about to bring down upon the folk of this township a fury from the sky because they are evil-livers. ^qPickthall2934

And verily of that We have left a clear sign for people who have sense. ^qPickthall2935

AND [the tribes of] Ad and Thamud [too, did We destroy -] as should have become obvious to you from [whatever there remains of] their dwellings.

And (the tribes of) A'ad and Thamud! (Their fate) is manifest unto you from their (ruined and deserted) dwellings. Satan made their deeds seem fair unto them and so debarred them from the Way, though they were keen observers. ^qPickthall2938

And it was not God who wronged them, but it was they who had wronged themselves. ^qAsad2940


So We took each one in his sin; of them was he on whom We sent a hurricane, and of them was he who was overtaken by the (Awful) Cry, and of them was he whom We caused the earth to swallow, and of them was he whom We drowned. It was not for Allah to wrong them, but they wronged themselves. ^qPickthall2940
