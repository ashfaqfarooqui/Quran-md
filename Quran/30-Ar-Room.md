Ya'lamoona zaahiram minal hayaatid dunya wa hum 'anil Aakhirati hum ghaafiloon ^qTrans296

They know only some appearance of the life of the world, and are heedless of the Hereafter. ^qPickthall296

Awalam yatafakkaroo feee anfusihim; maa khalaqal laahus samaawaati wal arda wa maa bainahumaaa illaa bil haqqi wa ajalim musammaa; wa inna kaseeram minan naasi biliqaaa'i Rabbihim lakaafiroon ^qTrans297


Have they never learned to think for them­selves? God has not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them without [an inner] truth and a term set [by Him]: and yet, behold, there are many people who stubbornly deny the truth that they are destined to meet their Sustainer! ^qAsad297


Have they not pondered upon themselves? Allah created not the heavens and the earth, and that which is between them, save with truth and for a destined end. But truly many of mankind are disbelievers in the meeting with their Lord. ^qPickthall297


What, have they not considered within themselves? God created not the heavens and the earth, and what between them is, save with the truth and a stated term; yet most men disbelieve in the encounter with their Lord. ^qArberry297

# 9

Awalm yaseeroo fil ardi fa-yanzuroo kaifa kaana 'aaqibatul lazeena min qablihim; kaanooo ashadda minhhum quwwatanw wa asaarul arda wa 'amaroohaaa aksara mimmaa 'amaroohaa wa jaaa'athum Rusuluhum bil baiyinaati famaa kaanal laahu liyazli mahum wa laakin kaanooo anfusahum yazlimoon ^qTrans298


Have they, then, never journeyed about the earth and beheld what happened in the end to those [deniers of the truth] who lived before their time? Greater were they in power than they are; and they left a stronger impact on the earth, and built it up even better than these [are doing]; and to them [too] came their apostles with all evidence of the truth: and so, [when they rejected the truth and thereupon perished,] it was not God who wronged them, but it was they who had wronged themselves. ^qAsad298


Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them? They were stronger than these in power, and they dug the earth and built upon it more than these have built. Messengers of their own came unto them with clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty). Surely Allah wronged them not, but they did wrong themselves. ^qPickthall298


What, have they not journeyed in the land and beheld how was the end of those before them? They were stronger than themselves in might, and they ploughed up the earth and cultivated it more than they themselves have cultivated it; and their Messengers came to them with the clear signs; and God would never wrong them, but themselves they wronged. ^qArberry298

# 10

Summa kaana'aaqibatal lazeena asaaa'us sooo aaa an kazzaboo bi aayaatil laahi wa kaanoo bihaa yastahzi'oon ^qTrans299


And once again: evil is bound to be the end of those who do evil by giving the lie to God’s messages and deriding them. ^qAsad299


Then evil was the consequence to those who dealt in evil, because they denied the revelations of Allah and made a mock of them. ^qPickthall299


Then the end of those that did evil was evil, for that they cried lies to the signs of God and mocked at them. ^qArberry299

# 11

Allaahu yabda'ul khalqa summa yu'eeduhoo summa ilaihi turja'oon ^qTrans2910


GOD CREATES [man] in the first instance, and then brings him forth anew: and, in the end, unto Him you all will be brought back. ^qAsad2910


Allah produceth creation, then He reproduceth it, then unto Him ye will be returned. ^qPickthall2910


God originates creation, then brings it back again, then unto Him you shall be returned. ^qArberry2910

# 12

Wa yawma taqoomus Saa'atu yublisul mujrimoon ^qTrans2911


And when the last Hour dawns, those who were lost in sin will be broken in spirit ^qAsad2911

Upon the day when the Hour is come, the sinners shall be confounded ^qArberry2911

for they will have no intercessors in the beings to whom they were wont to ascribe a share in God’s divinity, seeing that [by then] they themselves will have ceased to believe in their erstwhile blasphemous fancies. ^qAsad2912


There will be none to intercede for them of those whom they made equal with Allah. And they will reject their partners (whom they ascribed unto Him). ^qPickthall2912


no intercessors shall they have amongst their associates, and they shall disbelieve in their associates. ^qArberry2912

# 14

Wa Yawma taqoomus Saa'atu Yawma'iziny yatafarraqoon ^qTrans2913


And when the Last Hour dawns - on that Day will all [men] be sorted out: ^qAsad2913


In the day when the Hour cometh, in that day they will be sundered. ^qPickthall2913


Upon the day when the Hour is come, that day they shall be divided; ^qArberry2913

# 15

Fa ammal lazeena aamanoo wa 'amilus saalihaati fahum fee rawdatiny yuhbaroon ^qTrans2914


as for those who attained to faith and did righteous deeds, they shall be made happy in a garden of delight; ^qAsad2914

# 16

Wa ammal lazeena kafaroo wa kazzaboo bi-Aayaatinaa wa liqaaa'il Aakhirati faulaaa'ika fil'azaabi muhdaroon ^qTrans2915


but as for those who refused to acknowledge the truth and gave the lie to Our messages - and (thus) to the announce­ment of a life to come - they will be given over to suffering. ^qAsad2915


But as for those who disbelieved and denied Our revelations, and denied the meeting of the Hereafter, such will be brought to doom. ^qPickthall2915


but as for those who disbelieved, and cried lies to Our signs and the encounter of the Hereafter, they shall be arraigned into the chastisement. ^qArberry2915

# 17

Fa Subhaanal laahi heena tumsoona wa heena tusbihoon ^qTrans2916


EXTOL, then, God’s limitless glory when you enter upon the evening hours, and when you rise at morn; ^qAsad2916


So glory be to Allah when ye enter the night and when ye enter the morning - ^qPickthall2916


So glory be to God both in your evening hour and in your morning hour. ^qArberry2916

# 18

Wa lahul hamdu fis samaawaati wal ardi wa 'ashiyyanw wa heena tuzhiroon ^qTrans2917


and [seeing that] unto Him is due all praise in the heavens and on earth, [glorify Him] in the afternoon as well, and when you enter upon the hour of noon. ^qAsad2917


Unto Him be praise in the heavens and the earth! - and at the sun's decline and in the noonday. ^qPickthall2917


His is the praise in the heavens and earth, alike at the setting sun and in your noontide hour. ^qArberry2917

# 19

Yukhrijul haiya minal maiyiti wa yukhrijul maiyita minal haiyi wa yuhyil arda ba'da mawtihaa; wa kazaalika tukhrajoon ^qTrans2918


He [it is who] brings forth the living out of that which is dead, and brings forth the dead out of that which is alive, and gives life to the earth after it had been lifeless: and even thus will you be brought forth [from death to life] ^qAsad2918


He bringeth forth the living from the dead, and He bringeth forth the dead from the living, and He reviveth the earth after her death. And even so will ye be brought forth. ^qPickthall2918


He brings forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the dead from the living, and He revives the earth after it is dead; even so you shall be brought forth. ^qArberry2918

# 20

Wa min Aayaatiheee an khalaqakum min turaabin summa izaaa antum basharun tantashiroon ^qTrans2919


And among His wonders is this: He creates you out of dust – and then, lo! you become human beings ranging far and wide! ^qAsad2919


And of His signs is this: He created you of dust, and behold you human beings, ranging widely! ^qPickthall2919


And of His signs is that He created you of dust; then lo, you are mortals, all scattered abroad. ^qArberry2919

# 21

Wa min Aayaatiheee an khalaqa lakum min anfusikum azwaajal litaskunooo ilaihaa wa ja'ala bainakum mawad datanw wa rahmah; inna fee zaalika la Aayaatil liqawminy yatafakkaroon ^qTrans2920


And among His wonders is this: He creates for you mates out of your own kind. so that you might incline towards them, and He engenders love and tenderness between you: in this, behold, there are messages indeed for people who think! ^qAsad2920


And of His signs is this: He created for you helpmeets from yourselves that ye might find rest in them, and He ordained between you love and mercy. Lo! herein indeed are portents for folk who reflect. ^qPickthall2920


And of His signs is that He created for you, of yourselves, spouses, that you might repose in them, and He has set between you love and mercy. Surely in that are signs for a people who consider. ^qArberry2920

# 22

Wa min Aayaatihee khalqus samaawaati wal aardi wakhtilaafu alsinatikum wa alwaanikum; inna fee zaalika la Aayaatil lil'aalimeen ^qTrans2921


And among his wonders is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the diversity of your tongues and colours: for in this, behold, there are messages indeed for all who are possessed of [innate] knowledge! ^qAsad2921


And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of your languages and colours. Lo! herein indeed are portents for men of knowledge. ^qPickthall2921


And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and the variety of your tongues and hues. Surely in that are signs for all living beings. ^qArberry2921

# 23

Wa min Aayaatihee manaamukum bil laili wannahaari wabtighaaa'ukum min fadlih; inna fee zaalika la Aayaatil liqawminy yasma'oon ^qTrans2922


And among His wonders is your sleep, at night or in daytime, as well as your [ability to go about in] quest of some of His bounties: in this, behold, there are messages indeed for people who [are willing to] listen! ^qAsad2922


And of His signs is your slumber by night and by day, and your seeking of His bounty. Lo! herein indeed are portents for folk who heed. ^qPickthall2922

# 24

Wa min Aayaatihee yureekumul barqa khawfanw wa tama'anw wa yunazzilu minas samaaa'i maaa'an fa yuhyee bihil arda ba'da mawtihaaa inna fee zaalika la Aayaatil liqawminy ya'qiloon ^qTrans2923


And among His wonders is this: He displays before you the lightning, giving rise to [both] fear and hope, and sends down water from the skies, giving life thereby to the earth after it had been lifeless: in this, behold, there are messages indeed for people who use their reason! ^qAsad2923

Wa min Aayaatihee an taqoomas samaaa'u wal ardu bi-amrih; summa izaa da'aakum da'watam minal ardi izaaa antum takhrujoon ^qTrans2924


And among His wonders is this: the skies and the earth stand firm at His behest. [Remember all this: for] in the end, when He will call you forth from the earth with a single call - lo! you will [all] emerge [for judgment]. ^qAsad2924


And of His signs is this: The heavens and the earth stand fast by His command, and afterward, when He calleth you, lo! from the earth ye will emerge. ^qPickthall2924


And of His signs is that the heaven and earth stand firm by His command; then, when He calls you once and suddenly, out of the earth, lo you shall come forth. ^qArberry2924

# 26

Wa lahoo man fissamaawaati wal ardi kullul lahoo qaanitoon ^qTrans2925


For, unto Him belongs every being that is in the heavens and on earth; all things devoutly obey His will. ^qAsad2925


Unto Him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. All are obedient unto Him. ^qPickthall2925


To Him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and the earth; all obey His will. ^qArberry2925

# 27

Wa Huwal lazee yabda'ul khalqa summa yu'eeduhoo wa huwa ahwanu 'alaih; wa lahul masalul la'laa fissamaawaati wal-ard; wa Huwal 'Azeezul Hakeem ^qTrans2926


And He it is who creates [all life] in the first instance, and then brings it forth anew: and most easy is this for Him, since His is the essence of all that is most sublime in the heavens and on earth, and He alone is almighty, truly wise. ^qAsad2926


He it is Who produceth creation, then reproduceth it, and it is easier for Him. His is the Sublime Similitude in the heavens and the earth. He is the Mighty, the Wise. ^qPickthall2926


And it is He who originates creation, then brings it back again, and it is very easy for Him. His is the loftiest likeness in the heavens and the earth; He is the All-mighty, the All-wise. ^qArberry2926

# 28

Daraba lakum masalam min anfusikum hal lakum mimmaa malakat aymaanukum min shurakaaa'a fee maa razaqnaakum fa antum feehi sawaaa'un takhaafoonahum kakheefa tikum anfusakum; kazaalika nufassilul Aayaati liqawminy ya'qiloon ^qTrans2927


He propounds unto you a parable drawn from your own life: Would you [agree to] have some of those whom your right hands possess as [full-fledged] partners in whatever We may have bestowed upon you as sustenance, so that you [and they] would have equal shares in it, and you would fear [to make use of it without consulting] them, just as you might fear [the more powerful of] your equals? Thus clearly do We spell out these messages unto people who use their reason. ^qAsad2927


He coineth for you a similitude of yourselves. Have ye, from among those whom your right hands possess, partners in the wealth We have bestowed upon you, equal with you in respect thereof, so that ye fear them as ye fear each other (that ye ascribe unto Us partners out of that which We created)? Thus We display the revelations for people who have sense. ^qPickthall2927


He has struck for you a similitude from yourselves; do you have, among that your right hands own, associates in what We have provided for you so that you are equal in regard to it, you fearing them as you fear each other? So We distinguish the signs for a people who understand. ^qArberry2927

# 29

Balit taba'al lazeena zalamooo ahwaaa'ahum bighairi 'ilmin famai yahdee man adallal laahu wa maa lahum min naasireen ^qTrans2928


But nay - they who are bent on evildoing fol­low but their own desires, without having any knowl­edge (of the truth). And who could guide those whom God has [thus] let go astray, and who (thereupon) have none to succour them? ^qAsad2928


Nay, but those who do wrong follow their own lusts without knowledge. Who is able to guide him whom Allah hath sent astray? For such there are no helpers. ^qPickthall2928


Nay, but the evildoers follow their own caprices, without knowledge; so who shall guide those whom God has led astray? They have no helpers. ^qArberry2928

# 30

Fa aqim wajhaka liddeeni Haneefaa; fitratal laahil latee fataran naasa 'alaihaa; laa taabdeela likhalqil laah; zaalikad deenul qaiyimu wa laakinna aksaran naasi laa ya'lamoon ^qTrans2929


AND SO, set thy face steadfastly towards the [one ever-true] faith, turning away from all that is false, in accordance with the natural disposition which God has instilled into man: [for,] not to allow any change to corrupt what God has thus created this is the [purpose of the one] ever-true faith; but most people know it not. ^qAsad2929


So set thy purpose (O Muhammad) for religion as a man by nature upright - the nature (framed) of Allah, in which He hath created man. There is no altering (the laws of) Allah's creation. That is the right religion, but most men know not - ^qPickthall2929


So set thy face to the religion, a man of pure faith -- God's original upon which He originated mankind. There is no changing God's creation. That is the right religion; but most men know it not -- ^qArberry2929

# 31

Muneebeena ilaihi wattaqoohu wa aqeemus Salaata wa laa takoonoo minal mushrikeen ^qTrans2930


[Turn, then, away from all that is false,] turn­ing unto Him [alone]; and remain conscious of Him, and be constant in prayer, and be not among those who ascribe divinity to aught beside Him, ^qAsad2930


Turning unto Him (only); and be careful of your duty unto Him and establish worship, and be not of those who ascribe partners (unto Him); ^qPickthall2930


turning to Him. And fear you Him, and perform the prayer, and be not of the idolaters, ^qArberry2930

# 32

Minal lazeena farraqoo deenahum wa kaanoo shiya'an kullu hizbim bimaa ladaihim farihoon ^qTrans2931


[or] among those who have broken the unity of their faith and have become sects, each group delighting in but what they themselves hold [by way of tenets]. ^qAsad2931


Of those who split up their religion and became schismatics, each sect exulting in its tenets. ^qPickthall2931


even of those who have divided up their religion, and become sects, each several party rejoicing in what is theirs. ^qArberry2931

# 33

Wa izaa massan naasa durrun da'aw Rabbahum muneebeena ilaihi summa izaaa azaqahum minhu rahmatan izaa fareequm minhum be Rabbihim yushrikoon ^qTrans2932


NOW [thus it is:] when affliction befalls men, they cry out unto their Sustainer, turning unto Him [for help]; but as soon as He lets them taste of His grace, lo! some of them [begin to] ascribe to other powers a share in their Sustainer’s divinity, ^qAsad2932


And when harm toucheth men they cry unto their Lord, turning to Him in repentance; then, when they have tasted of His mercy, behold! some of them attribute partners to their Lord ^qPickthall2932


When some affliction visits mankind, they call unto their Lord, turning to Him; then, when He lets them taste mercy from Him, lo, a party of them assign associates to their Lord, ^qArberry2932

# 34

Li yakfuroo bimaaa aatainaahum; fatamatta'oo fasawfa ta'lamoon ^qTrans2933


[as if] to prove their ingratitude for all that We have granted them! Enjoy, then, your [brief] life: but in time you will come to know [the truth]! ^qAsad2933


So as to disbelieve in that which We have given them. (Unto such it is said): Enjoy yourselves awhile, but ye will come to know. ^qPickthall2933


that they may be ungrateful for what We have given them. 'Take your enjoyment; certainly you will soon know.' ^qArberry2933

# 35

Am anzalnaa 'alaihim sultaanan fahuwa yatakallamu bimaa kaanoo bihee yushrikoon ^qTrans2934


Have We ever bestowed upon them from on high a divine writ which would speak [with appro­val] of their worshipping aught beside Us? ^qAsad2934


Or have We revealed unto them any warrant which speaketh of that which they associate with Him? ^qPickthall2934


Or have We sent down any authority upon them, such as speaks of that they associate with Him? ^qArberry2934

# 36

Wa izaaa azaqnan naasa rahmatan farihoo bihaa wa in tusibhum sayyi'atum bimaa qaddamat aydeehim izaa hum yaqnatoon ^qTrans2935


And [thus it is:] when we let men taste [Our] grace, they rejoice in it; but if evil befalls them as an outcome of what their own hands have wrought lo! they lose all hope! ^qAsad2935


And when We cause mankind to taste of mercy they rejoice therein; but if an evil thing befall them as the consequence of their own deeds, lo! they are in despair! ^qPickthall2935


And when We let men taste mercy, they rejoice in it; but if some evil befalls them for that their own hands have forwarded, behold, they despair. ^qArberry2935

# 37

Awalam yaraw annal laaha yabsutur rizqa limai yashaaa'u wa yaqdir; inna fee zaalika la Aayaatil liqawminy yu'minoon ^qTrans2936


Are they, then, not aware that it is God who grants abundant sustenance, or gives it in scant measure, unto whomever He wills? In this, behold, there are messages indeed for peo­ple who will believe! ^qAsad2936


See they not that Allah enlargeth the provision for whom He will, and straiteneth (it for whom He will). Lo! herein indeed are portents for folk who believe. ^qPickthall2936


Have they not seen that God outspreads and straitens His provision to whom He will? Surely in that are signs for a people who believe. ^qArberry2936

# 38

Fa aati zal qurbaa haqqahoo walmiskeena wabnassabeel; zaalika khairul lil lazeena yureedoona Wajhal laahi wa ulaaa'ika humul muflihoon ^qTrans2937


Hence, give his due to the near of kin, as well as to the needy and the wayfarer; this is best for all who seek God’s countenance: for it is they, they that shall attain to a happy state! ^qAsad2937


So give to the kinsman his due, and to the needy, and to the wayfarer. That is best for those who seek Allah's Countenance. And such are they who are successful. ^qPickthall2937


And give the kinsman his right, and the needy, and the traveller; that is better for those who desire God's Face; those they are the prosperers. ^qArberry2937

# 39

Wa maaa aataitum mir ribal li yarbuwa feee amwaalin naasi falaa yarboo 'indal laahi wa maaa aataitum min zaakaatin tureedoona wajhal laahi fa ulaaa'ika humul mud'ifoon ^qTrans2938


And [remember:] whatever you may give out in usury so that it might increase through [other] people’s possessions will bring [you] no increase in the sight of God whereas all that you give out in charity, seeking God’s countenance, [will be blessed by Him:] for it is they, they [who thus seek His countenance] that shall have their recompense mul­tiplied! ^qAsad2938


That which ye give in usury in order that it may increase on (other) people's property hath no increase with Allah; but that which ye give in charity, seeking Allah's Countenance, hath increase manifold. ^qPickthall2938


And what you give in usury, that it may increase upon the people's wealth, increases not with God; but what you give in alms, desiring God's Face, those -- they receive recompense manifold. ^qArberry2938

IT IS GOD who has created you, and then has provided you with sustenance, and then will cause you to die, and then will bring you to life again. Can any of those beings or powers to whom you ascribe a share in His divinity do any of these things? Limitless is He in His glory, and sublimely exalted above anything to which men may ascribe a share in His divinity! ^qAsad2939


Allah is He Who created you and then sustained you, then causeth you to die, then giveth life to you again. Is there any of your (so-called) partners (of Allah) that doeth aught of that? Praised and Exalted be He above what they associate (with Him)! ^qPickthall2939
