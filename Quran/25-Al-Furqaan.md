Hallowed is He who from on high, step by step, has bestowed upon His servant the standard by which to discern the true from the false, so that to all the world it might be a warning: ^qAsad240

Allazee lahoo mulkus samaawaati wal ardi wa lam yattakhiz waladanw wa lam yakul lahoo shareekun filmulki wa khalaqa kulla shai'in faqaddarahoo taqdeeraa ^qTrans241


He to whom the dominion over the heavens and the earth belongs, and who begets no offspring, and has no partner in His dominion: for it is He who creates every thing and determines its nature in accordance with [His own] design. ^qAsad241


He unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, He hath chosen no son nor hath He any partner in the Sovereignty. He hath created everything and hath meted out for it a measure. ^qPickthall241


to whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and He has not taken to Him a son, and He has no associate in the Kingdom; and He created every thing, then He ordained it very exactly. ^qArberry241

Wattakhazoo min dooniheee aahihatal laa yakhluqoona shai'anw wa hum yukhlaqoona wa laa yamlikoona li anfusihim darranw wa laa naf'anw wa laa yamlikoona mawtanw wa laa hayaatanw wa laa nushooraa ^qTrans242


And yet, some choose to worship, instead of Him, imaginary deities that cannot create anything but are themselves created, and have it not within their power to avert harm from, or bring benefit to, themselves, and have no power over death, nor over life, nor over resurrection! ^qAsad242


Yet they choose beside Him other gods who create naught but are themselves created, and possess not hurt nor profit for themselves, and possess not death nor life, nor power to raise the dead. ^qPickthall242


Yet they have taken to them gods, apart from Him, that create nothing and themselves are created, and have no power to hurt or profit themselves, no power of death or life or raising up. ^qArberry242

Wa qaalal lazeena kafarooo in haazaaa illaaa ifkunif taraahu wa a'aanahoo 'alaihi qawmun aakharoona faqad jaaa'oo zulmanw wa zooraa ^qTrans243


Moreover, those who are bent on denying the truth are wont to say, “This [Qur’an] is nothing but a lie, which he [himself] has devised with the help of other people, who thereupon have perverted the truth and brought a falsehood into being.” ^qAsad243


Those who disbelieve say: This is naught but a lie that he hath invented, and other folk have helped him with it, so that they have produced a slander and a lie. ^qPickthall243


The unbelievers say, 'This is naught but a calumny he has forged, and other folk have helped him to it.' So they have committed wrong and falsehood. ^qArberry243

Say [O Muhammad]: “He who knows all the mysteries of the heavens and the earth has bestowed from on high this [Qur’an upon me]! Verily, He is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace!” ^qAsad245


Say (unto them, O Muhammad): He who knoweth the secret of the heavens and the earth hath revealed it. Lo! He ever is Forgiving, Merciful. ^qPickthall245


Say: 'He sent it down, who knows the secret in the heavens and earth; He is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.' ^qArberry245

Wa qaaloo maa li haazar Rasooli yaakulut ta'aama wa yamshee fil aswaaq; law laaa unzila ilaihi malakun fa yakoona ma'ahoo nazeeraa ^qTrans246


Yet they say: What sort of apostle is this [man] who eats food [like all other mortals] and goes about in the market places? Why has not an angel [visibly] been sent down unto him, to act as a warner together with him?” ^qAsad246


And they say: What aileth this messenger (of Allah) that he eateth food and walketh in the markets? Why is not an angel sent down unto him, to be a warner with him. ^qPickthall246


They also say, 'What ails this Messenger that he eats food, and goes in the markets? Why has an angel not been sent down to him, to be a warner with him? ^qArberry246

Aw yulqaaa ilaihi kanzun aw takoonu lahoo jannatuny yaakulu minhaa; wa qaalaz zaalimoona in tattabi'oona illaa rajulam mas hooraa ^qTrans247


Or: “[Why has not] a treasure been granted to him [by God]?” Or: “He should [at least] have a [bountiful] garden, so that he could eat thereof [without effort]!” And so these evildoers say [unto one another], “If you were to follow [Muhammad, you would follow] but a man bewitched!” ^qAsad247


Or (why is not) treasure thrown down unto him, or why hath he not a paradise from whence to eat? And the evil-doers say: Ye are but following a man bewitched. ^qPickthall247


Or why is not a treasure thrown to him, or why has he not a Garden to eat of?' The evildoers say, 'You are only following a man bewitched!' ^qArberry247

Unzur kaifa daraboo lakal amsaala fadalloo falaa yastatee'oona sabeelaa ^qTrans248


See to what they liken thee, [O Prophet, simply] because they have gone astray and are now unable to find a way to the truth]! ^qAsad248


See how they coin similitudes for thee, so that they are all astray and cannot find a road! ^qPickthall248


Behold, how they strike similitudes for thee, and go astray, and are unable to find a way! ^qArberry248

Tabaarakal lazeee in shaaa'a ja'ala laka khairam min zaalika jannaatin tajree min tahtihal anhaaru wa yaj'al laka qusooraa ^qTrans249


Hallowed is He who, if it be His will, shall give thee something better than that [whereof they speak] - gardens through which running waters flow - and shall assign to thee mansions [of bliss in the life to come]. ^qAsad249


Blessed is He Who, if He will, will assign thee better than (all) that - Gardens underneath which rivers flow - and will assign thee mansions. ^qPickthall249

Bal kazzaboo bis Saa'ati wa a'tadnaa liman kazzaba bis Saa'ati sa'eeraa ^qTrans2410


But nay! It is [the very coming of] the Last Hour to which they give the lie! However, for such as give the lie to [the announce­ment of] the Last Hour We have readied a blazing flame: ^qAsad2410


Nay, but they deny (the coming of) the Hour, and for those who deny (the coming of) the Hour We have prepared a flame. ^qPickthall2410


Nay, but they cry lies to the Hour; and We have prepared for him who cries lies to the Hour a Blaze. ^qArberry2410

Wa izaaa ulqoo minhaa makaanan daiyiqam muqar raneena da'aw hunaalika subooraa ^qTrans2412


and when they are flung, linked [all] together, into a tight space within, they will pray for extinction there and then! ^qAsad2412


And when they are flung into a narrow place thereof, chained together, they pray for destruction there. ^qPickthall2412


And when they are cast, coupled in fetters, into a narrow place of that Fire, they will call out there for destruction. ^qArberry2412

Qul azaalika khairun am Jannatul khuldil latee wu'idal muttaqoon; kaanat lahum jazaaa'anw wa maseeraa ^qTrans2414


Say: “Which is better - that, or the paradise of life abiding which has been promised to the God-conscious as their reward and their journey’s end – ^qAsad2414


Say: Is that (doom) better or the Garden of Immortality which is promised unto those who ward off (evil)? It will be their reward and journey's end. ^qPickthall2414


Say: 'Is that better, or the Garden of Eternity, that is promised to the godfearing, and is their recompense and homecoming?' ^qArberry2414

# 16

Lahum feehaa maa yashaaa'oona khaalideen; kaana 'alaa Rabbika wa'dam mas'oolaa ^qTrans2415


a promise given by thy Sustainer, [always] to be prayed for?” ^qAsad2415


Therein abiding, they have all that they desire. It is for thy Lord a promise that must be fulfilled. ^qPickthall2415


Therein they shall have what they will dwelling forever; it is a promise binding upon thy Lord, and of Him to be required. ^qArberry2415

Wa Yawma yahshuruhum wa maa ya'budoona min doonil lahi fa yaqoolu 'a-antum adlaltum 'ibaadee haaa'ulaaa'i am hum dallus sabeel ^qTrans2416


BUT [as for people who are oblivious of thy Sus­tainer’s oneness -] one Day He will gather them together with all that they [now] worship instead of God, and will ask [those to whom divinity was falsely ascribed]: “Was it you who led these My creatures astray, or did they by themselves stray from the right path?” ^qAsad2416


And on the day when He will assemble them and that which they worship instead of Allah and will say: Was it ye who misled these my slaves or did they (themselves) wander from the way? ^qPickthall2416


Upon the day when He shall muster them and that they serve, apart from God, and He shall say, 'Was it you that led these My servants astray, or did they themselves err from the way?' ^qArberry2416

Qaaloo Subhaanaka maa kaana yambaghee lanaaa an nattakhiza min doonika min awliyaaa'a wa laakim matta'tahum wa aabaaa'ahum hattaa nasuz zikra wa kaanoo qawmam booraa ^qTrans2417


They will answer: “Limitless art Thou in Thy glory! It was inconceivable for us to take for our masters anyone but Thyself! But [as for them -] Thou didst allow them and their forefathers to enjoy [the pleasures of] life to such an extent that they forgot all remembrance [of Thee]: for they were people devoid of all good.” ^qAsad2417


They will say: Be Thou Glorified! it was not for us to choose any protecting friends beside thee; but Thou didst give them and their fathers ease till they forgot the warning and became lost folk. ^qPickthall2417


They shall 'Glory be to Thee! It did not behove us to take unto say, ourselves protectors apart from Thee; but Thou gavest them and their fathers enjoyment of days, until they forgot ^qArberry2417

Faqad kazzabookum bimaa taqooloona famaa tastatee'oona sarfanw wa laa nasraa; wa mai yazlim minkum nuziqhu 'azaaban kabeeraa ^qTrans2418


[Thereupon God will say:] “And now, they [whom you regarded as divine] have given the lie to all your [past] assertions, and you can neither ward off [your punishment] nor obtain any succour! For, whoever of you has committed [such] evil, him shall We cause to taste great suffering!” ^qAsad2418


Thus they will give you the lie regarding what ye say, then ye can neither avert (the doom) nor obtain help. And whoso among you doeth wrong, We shall make him taste great torment. ^qPickthall2418


the Remembrance, and were a people corrupt.' So they cried lies touching the things you say, and you can neither turn it aside, nor find any help. Whosoever of you does evil, We shall let him taste a great chastisement. ^qArberry2418

Wa maaa arsalnaa qablaka minal mursaleena illaaa innahum la yaakuloonat ta'aama wa yamshoona fil aswaaq; wa ja'alnaa ba'dakum liba'din fitnatan atasbiroon; wa kaana Rabbuka Baseera ^qTrans2419


AND [even] before thee, [O Muhammad,] We never sent as Our message-bearers any but [mortal men] who indeed ate food [like other human beings] and went about in the market places: for [it is thus that] We cause you [human beings] to be a means of testing one another. Are you able to endure [this test] with patience? For [remember, O man,] thy Sustainer is truly all-seeing! ^qAsad2419


We never sent before thee any messengers but lo! they verily ate food and walked in the markets. And We have appointed some of you a test for others: Will ye be steadfast? And thy Lord is ever Seer. ^qPickthall2419


And We sent not before thee any Envoys, but that they ate food, and went in the markets; and We appointed some of you to be a trial for others: 'Will you endure?' Thy Lord is ever All-seeing. ^qArberry2419

Wa qaalal lazeena laa yarjoona liqaaa'anaa law laaa unzila 'alainal malaaa'ikatu awnaraa Rabbanaa; laqadistakbaroo feee anfusihim wa 'ataw 'utuwwan kabeeraa ^qTrans2420


But those who do not believe that they are destined to meet Us are wont to say, “Why have no angels been sent down to us?” – or, “Why do we not see our Sustainer?” Indeed, they are far too proud of themselves, hav­ing rebelled [against God’s truth] with utter disdain! ^qAsad2420


And those who look not for a meeting with Us say: Why are angels not sent down unto us and (Why) do we not see our Lord! Assuredly they think too highly of themselves and are scornful with great pride. ^qPickthall2420


Say those who look not to encounter Us, 'Why have the angels not been sent down on us, or why see we not our Lord?' Waxed proud they have within them, and become greatly disdainful. ^qArberry2420

Yawma yarawnal malaaa 'ikata laa bushraa Yawma'izil lilmujrimeena wa yaqooloona hijram mahjooraa ^qTrans2421


[Yet] on that Day - the Day on which they shall see the angels there will be no glad tiding for those who were lost in sin; and they will exclaim, “By a forbidding ban [are we from God’s grace debarred]!” – ^qAsad2421


On the day when they behold the angels, on that day there will be no good tidings for the guilty; and they will cry: A forbidding ban! ^qPickthall2421


Upon the day that they see the angels, no good tidings that day for the sinners; they shall say, 'A ban forbidden!' ^qArberry2421

# 23

Wa qadimnaaa ilaa maa 'amiloo min 'amalin faja'alnaahu habaaa'am mansooraa ^qTrans2422


for We shall have turned towards all the [supposedly good] deeds they ever wrought, and shall have transformed them into scattered dust – ^qAsad2422


And We shall turn unto the work they did and make it scattered motes. ^qPickthall2422


We shall advance upon what work they have done, and make it a scattered dust. ^qArberry2422

# 24

As haabul jannati yawma'izin khairum mustaqar ranw wa ahsanu maqeela ^qTrans2423


[whereas] on that same Day those who are destined for paradise will be graced with the best of abodes and the fairest place of repose. ^qAsad2423


Those who have earned the Garden on that day will be better in their home and happier in their place of noonday rest; ^qPickthall2423


The inhabitants of Paradise that day, better shall be their lodging, fairer their resting-place. ^qArberry2423

# 25

Wa Yawma tashaqqaqus samaaa'u bilghamaami wa nuzzilal malaaa'ikatu tanzeela ^qTrans2424


And on the Day on which the skies, together with the clouds, shall burst asunder, and the angels are made to descend in a mighty descent – ^qAsad2424


A day when the heaven with the clouds will be rent asunder and the angels will be sent down, a grand descent. ^qPickthall2424


Upon the day that heaven is split asunder with the clouds and the angels are sent down in majesty, ^qArberry2424

# 26

Almulku Yawma'izinil haqqu lir Rahmaan; wa kaana Yawman'alal kaafireena 'aseeraa ^qTrans2425


on that Day [it will become obvious to all that] true sover­eignty belongs to the Most Gracious [alone]: hence, a Day of distress will it be for all who deny the truth, ^qAsad2425


The Sovereignty on that day will be the True (Sovereignty) belonging to the Beneficent One, and it will be a hard day for disbelievers. ^qPickthall2425


the Kingdom that day, the true Kingdom, shall belong to the All-merciful and it shall be a day harsh for the unbelievers. ^qArberry2425

# 27

Wa Yawma ya'adduz zaalimu 'alaa yadaihi yaqoolu yaa laitanit takhaztu ma'ar Rasooli sabeelaa ^qTrans2426


and a Day on which the evildoer will bite his hands [in despair], exclaiming: “Oh, would that I had followed the path shown to me by the apostle! ^qAsad2426


On the day when the wrong-doer gnaweth his hands, he will say: Ah, would that I had chosen a way together with the messenger (of Allah)! ^qPickthall2426


Upon the day the evildoer shall bite his hands, saying, 'Would that I had taken a way along with the Messenger! ^qArberry2426

Oh, woe is me! Would that I had not taken so-and-so for a friend! ^qAsad2427


Alas for me! Ah, would that I had never taken such an one for friend! ^qPickthall2427


Alas, would that I had not taken So-and-so for a friend! ^qArberry2427

# 29

Laqad adallanee 'aniz zikri ba'da iz jaaa'anee; wa kaanash Shaitaanu lil insaani khazoolaa ^qTrans2428


Indeed, he led me astray from the remembrance [of God] after it had come unto me!” For [thus it is:] Satan is ever a betrayer of man. ^qAsad2428


He verily led me astray from the Reminder after it had reached me. Satan was ever man's deserter in the hour of need. ^qPickthall2428


He indeed led me astray from the Remembrance, after it had come to me; Satan is ever a forsaker of men.' ^qArberry2428

# 30

Wa qaalar Rasoolu yaa Rabbi inna qawmit takhazoo haazal Qur-aana mahjooraa ^qTrans2429


AND [on that Day] the Apostle will say: “O my Sustainer! Behold, [some of] my people have come to regard this Qur’an as something [that ought to be] discarded!” ^qAsad2429


And the messenger saith: O my Lord! Lo! mine own folk make this Qur'an of no account. ^qPickthall2429


The Messenger says, 'O my Lord, behold, my people have taken this Koran as a thing to be shunned.' ^qArberry2429

# 31

Wa kazaalika ja'alnaa likulli Nabiyyin 'aduwwam minal mujrimeen; wa kafaa bi Rabbika haadiyanw wa naseeraa ^qTrans2430


For so it is that against every prophet We have set up enemies from among those who are lost in sin: yet none can guide and give succour as thy Sustainer does! ^qAsad2430


Even so have We appointed unto every prophet an opponent from among the guilty; but Allah sufficeth for a Guide and Helper. ^qPickthall2430


Even so We have appointed to every Prophet an enemy among the sinners; but thy Lord suffices as a guide and as a helper. ^qArberry2430

Wa qaalal lazeena kafaroo law laa nuzzila 'alaihil Quraanu jumlatanw waahidah; kazaalika linusabbita bihee fu'aadaka wa rattalnaahu tarteelaa ^qTrans2431


Now they who are bent on denying the truth are wont to ask. “Why has not the Qur’an been bestowed on him from on high in one single re­velation?” [it has been revealed] in this manner so that We might strengthen thy heart thereby - for We have so arranged its component parts that they form one consistent whole - ^qAsad2431


And those who disbelieve say: Why is the Qur'an not revealed unto him all at once? (It is revealed) thus that We may strengthen thy heart therewith; and We have arranged it in right order. ^qPickthall2431


The unbelievers say, 'Why has the Koran not been sent down upon him all at once?' Even so, that We may strengthen thy heart thereby, and We have chanted it very distinctly. ^qArberry2431

# 33

Wa laa yaatoonaka bimasainn illaa ji'naaka bilhaqqi wa ahsana tafseeraa ^qTrans2432


and [that] they [who deny the truth] might never taunt thee with any deceptive half-truth without Our conveying to thee the [full] truth and [providing thee] with the best explanation. ^qAsad2432


And they bring thee no similitude but We bring thee the Truth (as against it), and better (than their similitude) as argument. ^qPickthall2432


They bring not to thee any similitude but that We bring thee the truth, and better in exposition. ^qArberry2432

Allazeena yuhsharoona 'alaa wujoohim ilaa jahannama ulaaa'ika sharrum makaananw wa adallu sabeelaa )section 3) ^qTrans2433


[And so, tell those who are bent on denying the truth that] they who shall be gathered unto hell upon their faces – it is they who [in the life to come] will be worst in station and still farther astray from the path [of truth]! ^qAsad2433


Those who will be gathered on their faces unto hell: such are worse in plight and further from the right road. ^qPickthall2433


Those who shall be mustered to Gehenna upon their faces -- they shall be worse in place, and gone further astray from the way. ^qArberry2433

Wa laqad aatainaa Moosal Kitaaba wa ja'alnaa ma'ahooo akhaahu Haaroona wazeeraa ^qTrans2434


AND, INDEED, [long before Muhammad] We vouchsafed revelation unto Moses, and appointed his brother Aaron to help him to bear his burden; ^qAsad2434


We verily gave Moses the Scripture and placed with him his brother Aaron as henchman. ^qPickthall2434


We gave Moses the Book, and appointed with him his brother Aaron as minister ^qArberry2434

# 36

Faqulnaz habaaa ilal qawmil lazeena kazzaboo bi Aayaatinaa fadammarnaahum tadmeeraa ^qTrans2435


and We said, “Go you both unto the people who have given the lie to Our messages!” - and thereupon We broke those [sinners] to smithereens. ^qAsad2435


Then We said: Go together unto the folk who have denied Our revelations. Then We destroyed them, a complete destruction. ^qPickthall2435


and We said, 'Go to the people who have cried lies to Our signs'; then We destroyed them utterly. ^qArberry2435

Wa qawma Noohil lammaa kazzabur Rusula aghraqnaahum wa ja'alnaahum linnaasi Aayatanw wa a'tadnaa lizzaalimeena 'azaaban aleemaa ^qTrans2436


And [think of] the people of Noah: when they gave the lie to [one of] the apostles, We caused them to drown, and made them a symbol for all mankind: for, grievous suffering have We readied for all who [knowingly] do wrong! ^qAsad2436


And Noah's folk, when they denied the messengers, We drowned them and made of them a portent for mankind. We have prepared a painful doom for evil-doers. ^qPickthall2436


And the people of Noah, when they cried lies to the Messengers, We drowned them, and made them to be a sign to mankind; and We have prepared for the evildoers a painful chastisement. ^qArberry2436

And [remember how We punished the tribes of] Ad and Thamud and the people of Ar-Rass, and many generations [of sinners] in-between: ^qAsad2437


And (the tribes of) A'ad and Thamud, and the dwellers in Ar-Rass, and many generations in between. ^qPickthall2437

and unto each of them did We proffer lessons and each of them did We destroy with utter destruction. ^qAsad2438


Each (of them) We warned by examples, and each (of them) We brought to utter ruin. ^qPickthall2438
