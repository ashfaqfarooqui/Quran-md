Sooratun anzalnaahaa wa faradnaahaa wa anzalnaa feehaaa Aayaatim baiyinaatil la'allakum tazakkaroon ^qTrans241


A Surah [is this] which We have bestowed from on high, and which We have laid down in plain terms; and in it have We bestowed from on high messages which are clear [in themselves], so that you might keep [them] in mind. ^qAsad241


(Here is) a surah which We have revealed and enjoined, and wherein We have revealed plain tokens, that haply ye may take heed. ^qPickthall241

Azzaaniyatu wazzaanee fajlidoo kulla waahidim minhumaa mi'ata jaldatinw wa laa taakhuzkum bihimaa raafatun fee deenil laahi in kuntum tu'minoona billaahi wal Yawmil Aakhiri wal yashhad 'azaabahumaa taaa'ifatum minal mu'mineen ^qTrans242


AS FOR the adulteress and the adulterer flog each of them with a hundred stripes, and let not compassion with them keep you from [carrying out] this law of God, if you [truly] believe in God and the Last Day; and let a group of the believers witness their chastisement. ^qAsad242


The adulterer and the adulteress, scourge ye each one of them (with) a hundred stripes. And let not pity for the twain withhold you from obedience to Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a party of believers witness their punishment. ^qPickthall242


The fornicatress and the fornicator -- scourge each one of them a hundred stripes, and in the matter of God's religion let no tenderness for them seize you if you believe in God and the Last Day; and let a party of the believers witness their chastisement. ^qArberry242

Azzaanee laa yankihu illaa zaaniyatan aw mushrikatanw wazzaaniyatu laa yankihuhaaa illaa zaanin aw mushrik; wa hurrima zaalika 'alal mu'mineen ^qTrans243


[Both are equally guilty:] the adulterer couples with none other than an adulteress - that is, a woman who accords [to her own lust] a place side by side with God; and with the adulteress couples none other than an adulterer - that is, a man who accords [to his own lust] a place side by side with God: and this is forbidden unto the believers. ^qAsad243


The adulterer shall not marry save an adulteress or an idolatress, and the adulteress none shall marry save an adulterer or an idolater. All that is forbidden unto believers. ^qPickthall243


The fornicator shall marry none but a fornicatress or an idolatress, and the fornicatress -- none shall marry her but a fornicator or an idolator; that is forbidden to the believers. ^qArberry243

And as for those who accuse chaste women [of adultery], and then are unable to produce four witnesses [in support of their accusation], flog them with eighty stripes and ever after refuse to accept from them any testimony - since it is they, they that are truly depraved! ^qAsad244


And those who accuse honourable women but bring not four witnesses, scourge them (with) eighty stripes and never (afterward) accept their testimony - They indeed are evil-doers - ^qPickthall244

Illal lazeena taaboo mim ba'di zaalika wa aslahoo fa innal laaha Ghafoorur Raheem ^qTrans245


excepting [from this interdict] only those who afterwards repent and made amends: for, behold, God is much forgiving, a dispenser of grace. ^qAsad245


Save those who afterward repent and make amends. (For such) lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. ^qPickthall245


save such as repent thereafter and make amends; surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate. ^qArberry245

Wal khaamisatu anna la'natal laahi 'alaihi in kaana minal kaazibeen ^qTrans247


and the fifth time, that God’s curse be upon him if he is telling a lie. ^qAsad247


And yet a fifth, invoking the curse of Allah on him if he is of those who lie. ^qPickthall247


and a fifth time, that the curse of God shall be upon him, if he should be of the liars. ^qArberry247

# 8

Wa yadra'u anhal 'azaaba an tashhada arba'a shahaa daatim billaahi innahoo laminal kaazibeen ^qTrans248

AND WERE it not for God’s favour upon you, [O man,] and His grace, and that God is a wise acceptor of repentance...! ^qAsad2410


And had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you, and that Allah is Clement, Wise, (ye had been undone). ^qPickthall2410


But for God's bounty to you and His mercy and that God turns, and is All-wise -- ^qArberry2410

Verily, numerous among you are those who would falsely accuse others of unchastity: [but, O you who are thus wronged,] deem it not a bad thing for you: nay, it is good for you! [As for the slanderers,] unto every one of them [will be accounted] all that he has earned by [thus] sinning; and awesome suffering awaits any of them who takes it upon himself to enhance this [sin]! ^qAsad2411


Lo! they who spread the slander are a gang among you. Deem it not a bad thing for you; nay, it is good for you. Unto every man of them (will be paid) that which he hath earned of the sin; and as for him among them who had the greater share therein, his will be an awful doom. ^qPickthall2411


Those who came with the slander are a band of you; do not reckon it evil for you; rather it is good for you. Every man of them shall have the sin that he has earned charged to him; and whosoever of them took upon himself the greater part of it, him there awaits a mighty chastisement. ^qArberry2411

Law laaa iz sami'tumoohu zannal mu'minoona walmu'minaatu bi anfusihim khairanw wa qaaloo haazaaa ifkum mmubeen ^qTrans2412


Why do not the believing men and women, whenever such [a rumour] is heard, think the best of one another and say, “This is an obvious falsehood”? ^qAsad2412


Why did not the believers, men and women, when ye heard it, think good of their own own folk, and say: It is a manifest untruth? ^qPickthall2412


Why, when you heard it, did the believing men and women not of their own account think good thoughts, and say, 'This is a manifest calumny'? ^qArberry2412

# 13

Law laa jaaa'oo 'alaihi bi-arba'ati shuhadaaa'; fa iz lam yaatoo bishshuhadaaa'i fa ulaaa 'ika 'indal laahi humul kaaziboon ^qTrans2413


why do they not [demand of the accusers that they] their allegation? for, if they do not produce such wit­nesses, it is those [accusers] who, in the sight of God, are liars indeed! ^qAsad2413


Why did they not produce four witnesses? Since they produce not witnesses, they verily are liars in the sight of Allah. ^qPickthall2413


Why did they not bring four witnesses against it? But since they did not bring the witnesses, in God's sight they are the liars. ^qArberry2413

# 14

Wa law laa fadlul laahi 'alaikum wa rahmatuhoo fiddunyaa wal aakhirati lamassakum fee maaa afadtum feehi 'azaabun 'azeem ^qTrans2414


And were it not for God’s favour upon you, [O men,] and His grace in this world and in the life to come, awesome suffering would indeed have afflicted you in result of all [the calumny] in which you indulge ^qAsad2414


Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you in the world and the Hereafter an awful doom had overtaken you for that whereof ye murmured. ^qPickthall2414


But for God's bounty to you and His mercy in the present world and the world to come there would have visited you for your mutterings a mighty chastisement. ^qArberry2414

when you take it up with your tongues, uttering with your mouths something of which you have no knowledge, and deeming it a light matter whereas in the sight of God it is an awful thing! ^qAsad2415


When ye welcomed it with your tongues, and uttered with your mouths that whereof ye had no knowledge, ye counted it a trifle. In the sight of Allah it is very great. ^qPickthall2415


When you received it on your tongues, and were speaking with your mouths that whereof you had no knowledge, and reckoned it a light thing, and with God it was a mighty thing -- ^qArberry2415

# 16

Wa law laaa iz sami'tu moohu qultum maa yakoonu lanaaa an natakallama bihaazaa Subhaanaka haaza buhtaanun 'azeem ^qTrans2416


And [once again]: Why do you not say, whenever you hear such [a rumour], “It does not behove us to speak of this, O Thou who art limitless in Thy glory: this is an awesome calumny”? ^qAsad2416


Wherefor, when ye heard it, said ye not: It is not for us to speak of this. Glory be to Thee (O Allah)! This is awful calumny. ^qPickthall2416


And why, when you heard it, did you not say, 'It is not for us to speak about this; glory be to Thee! This is a mighty calumny'? ^qArberry2416

# 17

Ya'izukumul laahu an ta'oodoo limisliheee abadan in kuntum mu'mineen ^qTrans2417


God admonishes you [hereby] lest you ever revert to the like of this [sin], if you are [truly] believers; ^qAsad2417


Allah admonisheth you that ye repeat not the like thereof ever, if ye are (in truth) believers. ^qPickthall2417


God admonishes you, that you shall never repeat the like of it again; if you are believers. ^qArberry2417

# 18

Wa yubaiyinul laahu lakumul Aayaat; wallaahu 'Aleemun Hakeem ^qTrans2418


for God makes [His] messages clear unto you - and God is all-knowing, Wise! ^qAsad2418


And He expoundeth unto you the revelations. Allah is Knower, Wise. ^qPickthall2418


God makes clear to you the signs; and God is All-knowing, All-wise. ^qArberry2418

Innal lazeena yuhibboona an tashee'al faahishatu fil lazeena aamanoo lahum 'azaabun aleemun fid dunyaa wal Aakhirah; wallaahu ya'lamu wa antum laa ta'lamoon ^qTrans2419


Verily, as for those who like [to hear] foul slander spread against [any of] those who have attained to faith grievous suffering awaits them in this world and in the life to come: for God knows [the full truth], whereas you know [it] not. ^qAsad2419


Lo! those who love that slander should be spread concerning those who believe, theirs will be a painful punishment in the world and the Hereafter. Allah knoweth. Ye know not. ^qPickthall2419


Those who love that indecency should be spread abroad concerning them that believe -- there awaits them a painful chastisement in the present world and the world to come; and God knows, and you know not. ^qArberry2419

Wa law laa fadlul laahi 'alaikum wa rahmatuhoo wa annal laaha Ra'oofur Raheem ^qTrans2420


And were it not for God’s favour upon you and His grace, and that God is compassionate, a dispenser of grace...! ^qAsad2420


Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you, and that Allah is Clement, Merciful, (ye had been undone). ^qPickthall2420


But for God's bounty to you and His mercy and that God is All-gentle, All-compassionate -- ^qArberry2420

# 21

Yaaa aiyuhal lazeena aamanoo laa tattabi'oo khutuwaatish Shaitaan; wa many-yattabi' khutuwaatish Shaitaani fa innahoo yaamuru bilfahshaaa'i walmunkar; wa law laa fadlul laahi 'alaikum wa rahmatuhoo maa zakaa minkum min ahadin abadanw wa laakinnal laaha yuzakkee many-yashaaa'; wallaahu Samee'un 'Aleem ^qTrans2421


O You who have attained to faith! Follow not Satan’s footsteps: for he who follows Satan’s foot­steps [will find that], behold, he enjoins but deeds of abomination and all that runs counter to reason. And were it not for God’s favour upon you and His grace, not one of you would ever have remained pure. For [thus it is:] God who causes whomever He wills to grow in purity: for God is all-hearing, all-­knowing. ^qAsad2421


O ye who believe! Follow not the footsteps of the devil. Unto whomsoever followeth the footsteps of the devil, lo! he commandeth filthiness and wrong. Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you, not one of you would ever have grown pure. But Allah causeth whom He will to grow. And Allah is Hearer, Knower. ^qPickthall2421


O believers, follow not the steps of Satan; for whosoever follows the steps of Satan, assuredly he bids to indecency and dishonour. But for God's bounty to you and His mercy not one of you would have been pure ever; but God purifies whom He will; and God is All-hearing, All-knowing. ^qArberry2421

Wa laa yaatali ulul fadli minkum wassa'ati ai yu'tooo ulil qurbaa walmasaakeena walmuhaajireena fee sabeelillaahi walya'foo walyasfahoo; alaa tuhibboona ai yaghfiral laahu lakum; wal laahu Ghafoorur Raheem ^qTrans2422


Hence, [even if they have been wronged by slander,] let not those of you who have been graced with God’s favour and ease of life ever become remiss in helping [the erring ones among] their near of kin, and the needy, and those who have forsaken the domain of evil for the sake of God, but let them pardon and forbear. [For,] do you not desire that God should forgive you your sins, seeing that God is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace? ^qAsad2422


And let not those who possess dignity and ease among you swear not to give to the near of kin and to the needy, and to fugitives for the cause of Allah. Let them forgive and show indulgence. Yearn ye not that Allah may forgive you? Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. ^qPickthall2422


Let not those of you who possess bounty and plenty swear off giving kinsmen and the poor and those who emigrate in the way of God; but let them pardon and forgive. Do you not wish that God should forgive you? God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate. ^qArberry2422

Innal lazeena yarmoonal muhsanaatil ghaafilaatil mu'minaati lu'inoo fid dunyaa wal Aakhirati wa lahum 'azaabun 'azeem ^qTrans2423


[But,] verily, those who [falsely, and without repentance,] accuse chaste women who may have been unthinkingly careless but have remained true to their faith, shall be rejected [from God’s grace] in this world as well as in the life to come: and awesome suffering awaits them ^qAsad2423


Lo! as for those who traduce virtuous, believing women (who are) careless, cursed are they in the world and the Hereafter. Theirs will be an awful doom ^qPickthall2423


Surely those who cast it up on women in wedlock that are heedless but believing shall be accursed in the present world and the world to come; and there awaits them a mighty chastisement ^qArberry2423

# 24

Yawma tashhhadu 'alaihim alsinatuhum wa aideehim wa arjuluhum bimaa kaanoo ya'maloon ^qTrans2424


on the Day when their own tongues and hands and feet will bear witness against them by [recalling] all that they did! ^qAsad2424


On the day when their tongues and their hands and their feet testify against them as to what they used to do, ^qPickthall2424


on the day when their tongues, their hands and their feet shall testify against them touching that they were doing. ^qArberry2424

# 25

Yawma'iziny yuwaf feehimul laahu deenahumul haqqa wa ya'lamoona annal laaha Huwal Haqqul Mubeen ^qTrans2425


On that day God will pay them in full their just due, and they will come to know that God alone is the Ultimate Truth, manifest, and manifesting [the true nature of all that has ever been done]. ^qAsad2425


On that day Allah will pay them their just due, and they will know that Allah, He is the Manifest Truth. ^qPickthall2425


Upon that day God will pay them in full their just due, and they shall know that God is the manifest Truth. ^qArberry2425

[In the nature of things,] corrupt women are for corrupt men, and corrupt men, for corrupt women - just as good women are for good men, and good men, for good women. [Since God is aware that] these are innocent of all that evil tongues may impute to them, forgiveness of sins shall be theirs, and a most excellent sustenance! ^qAsad2426


Vile women are for vile men, and vile men for vile women. Good women are for good men, and good men for good women; such are innocent of that which people say: For them is pardon and a bountiful provision. ^qPickthall2426


Corrupt women for corrupt men, and corrupt men for corrupt women; good women for good men, and good men for good women -- these are declared quit of what they say; theirs shall be forgiveness and generous provision. ^qArberry2426

O YOU who have attained to faith! Do not enter houses other than your own unless you have obtained permission and greeted their inmates. This is [enjoined upon you] for your own good, so that you might bear [your mutual rights] in mind. ^qAsad2427


O ye who believe! Enter not houses other than your own without first announcing your presence and invoking peace upon the folk thereof. That is better for you, that ye may be heedful. ^qPickthall2427


O believers, do not enter houses other than your houses until you first ask leave and, salute the people thereof; that is better for you; haply you will remember. ^qArberry2427

Fa il lam tajidoo feehaaa ahadan falaa tadkhuloohaa hattaa yu'zana lakum wa in qeela lakumurji'oo farji'oo huwa azkaa lakum; wallaahu bimaa ta'maloona 'Aleem ^qTrans2428


Hence, [even] if you find no one within [the house], do not enter it until you are given leave; and if you are told, “Turn back,” then turn back. This will be most conducive to your purity; and God has full knowledge of all that you do. ^qAsad2428


And if ye find no-one therein, still enter not until permission hath been given. And if it be said unto you: Go away again, then go away, for it is purer for you. Allah knoweth what ye do. ^qPickthall2428


And if you find not anyone therein, enter it not until leave is given to you. And if you are told, 'Return,' return; that is purer for you; and God knows the things you do. ^qArberry2428

# 29

Laisa 'alaikum junaahun ann tadkhuloo buyootan ghaira maskoonatin feeha mataa'ul lakum; wallaahu ya'lamu maa tubdoona wa maa taktumoon ^qTrans2429


[On the other hand,] you will incur no sin if you [freely] enter houses not intended for living in but serving a purpose useful to you: but [always remember that] God knows all that you do openly, and all that you would conceal. ^qAsad2429


(It is) no sin for you to enter uninhabited houses wherein is comfort for you. Allah knoweth what ye proclaim and what ye hide. ^qPickthall2429


There is no fault in you that you enter houses uninhabited wherein enjoyment is for you. God knows what you reveal and what you hide. ^qArberry2429

Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and to be mindful of their chastity: this will be most con­ducive to their purity – [and,] verily, God is aware of all that they do. ^qAsad2430


Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest. That is purer for them. Lo! Allah is aware of what they do. ^qPickthall2430

And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and to be mindful of their chastity, and not to display their charms [in public] beyond what may [decently] be apparent thereof; hence, let them draw their head-coverings over their bosoms. And let them not display [more of] their charms to any but their husbands, or their fathers, or their husbands’ fathers, or their sons, or their husbands’ Sons, or their brothers, or their brothers’ sons, or their sisters’ sons, or their womenfolk, or those whom they rightfully possess, or such male attendants as are beyond all sexual desire, or children that are as yet unaware of women’s nakedness; and let them not swing their legs [in walking] so as to draw attention to their hidden charms And [always], O you believers - all of you - turn unto God in repentance, so that you might attain to a happy state! ^qAsad2431


And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and be modest, and to display of their adornment only that which is apparent, and to draw their veils over their bosoms, and not to reveal their adornment save to their own husbands or fathers or husbands' fathers, or their sons or their husbands' sons, or their brothers or their brothers' sons or sisters' sons, or their women, or their slaves, or male attendants who lack vigour, or children who know naught of women's nakedness. And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And turn unto Allah together, O believers, in order that ye may succeed. ^qPickthall2431


And say to the believing women, that they cast down their eyes' and guard their private parts, and reveal not their adornment save such as is outward; and let them cast their veils over their bosoms, and not reveal their adornment save to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husbands' fathers, or their sons, or their husbands' sons, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or what their right hands own, or such men as attend them, not having sexual desire, or children who have not yet attained knowledge of women's private parts; nor let them stamp their feet, so that their hidden ornament may be known. And turn all together to God, O you believers; haply so you will prosper. ^qArberry2431

AND [you ought to] marry the single from among you as well as such of your male and female slaves as are fit [for marriage]. If they [whom you intend to marry] are poor, [let this not deter you;] God will grant them sufficiency out of His bounty - for God is infinite [in His mercy], all-knowing. ^qAsad2432

And as for those who are unable to marry, let them live in continence until God grants them sufficiency out of His bounty, And if any of those whom you rightfully possess desire [to obtain] a deed of freedom, write it out for them if you are aware of any good in them: and give them [their share of the wealth of God which He has given you. And do not, in order to gain some of the fleeting pleasures of this worldly life, coerce your [slave] maidens into whoredom if they happen to be desirous of marriage; and if anyone should coerce them, then, verily, after they have been compelled [to submit in their helplessness], God will be much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace! ^qAsad2433


And let those who cannot find a match keep chaste till Allah give them independence by His grace. And such of your slaves as seek a writing (of emancipation), write it for them if ye are aware of aught of good in them, and bestow upon them of the wealth of Allah which He hath bestowed upon you. Force not your slave-girls to whoredom that ye may seek enjoyment of the life of the world, if they would preserve their chastity. And if one force them, then (unto them), after their compulsion, lo! Allah will be Forgiving, Merciful. ^qPickthall2433


And let those who find not the means to marry be abstinent till God enriches them of His bounty. Those your right hands own who seek emancipation, contract with them accordingly, if you know some good in them; and give them of the wealth of God that He has given you. And constrain not your slave-girls to prostitution, if they desire to live in chastity, that you may seek the chance goods of the present life. Whosoever constrains them, surely God, after their being constrained, is All-forgiving, All-compassionate. ^qArberry2433

AND [know that] women advanced in years, who no longer feel any sexual desire, incur no sin if they discard their [outer] garments, provided they do not aim at a showy display of [their] charms. But [even so,] it is better for them to abstain [from this]: and God is all-hearing, all-knowing. ^qAsad2460


As for women past child-bearing, who have no hope of marriage, it is no sin for them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show adornment. But to refrain is better for them. Allah is Hearer, Knower. ^qPickthall2460


Such women as are past child- bearing and have no hope of marriage -- there is no fault in them that they put off their clothes, so be it that they flaunt no ornament; but to abstain is better for them; and God is All-hearing, All-knowing. ^qArberry2460

[ALL OF YOU, O believers, are brethren: hence.] no blame attaches to the blind, nor does blame attach to the lame, nor does blame attach to the sick [for accepting charity from the hale], and neither to your­selves for eating [whatever is offered to you by others, whether it be food obtained] from your [chil­dren’s] houses, or your fathers’ houses, or your mothers’ houses, or your brothers’ houses, or your sisters’ houses, or your paternal uncles’ houses, or your paternal aunts’ houses, or your maternal uncles’ houses, or your maternal aunts’ houses, or [houses] the keys whereof are in your charge! or [the house] of any of your friends; nor will you incur any sin by eating in company or separately. But whenever you enter [any of these] houses, greet one another with a blessed, goodly greeting, as enjoined by God. In this way God makes clear unto you His mes­sages, so that you might [learn to] use your reason. ^qAsad2461


No blame is there upon the blind nor any blame upon the lame nor any blame upon the sick nor on yourselves if ye eat from your houses, or the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your fathers' brothers, or the houses of your fathers' sisters, or the houses of your mothers' brothers, or the houses of your mothers' sisters, or (from that) whereof ye hold the keys, or (from the house) of a friend. No sin shall it be for you whether ye eat together or apart. But when ye enter houses, salute one another with a greeting from Allah, blessed and sweet. Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations for you, that haply ye may understand. ^qPickthall2461


There is no fault in the blind, and there is no fault in the lame, and there is no fault in the sick, neither in yourselves, that you eat of your houses, or your fathers' houses, or your mothers' houses, or your brothers' houses, or your sisters' houses, or the houses of your uncles or your aunts paternal, or the houses of your uncles or your aunts maternal, or that whereof you own the keys, or of your friend; there is no fault in you that you eat all together, or in groups separately. But when you enter houses, greet one another with a greeting from God, blessed and good. So God makes clear to you the signs; haply you will understand. ^qArberry2461

[TRUE BELIEVERS are only they who have attained to faith in God and His Apostle, and who, whenever they are [engaged] with him upon a matter of concern to the whole community do not depart [from whatever has been decided upon] unless they have sought [and obtained] his leave. Verily, those who [do not abstain from the agreed ­upon action unless they] ask leave of thee - it is [only] they who [truly] believe in God and His Apostle! Hence, when they ask leave of thee for some [valid] reason of their own, grant thou this leave to whomsoever of them thou choose [to grant it], and ask God to forgive them: for, behold, God is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace! ^qAsad2462


They only are the true believers who believe in Allah and His messenger and, when they are with him on some common errand, go not away until they have asked leave of him. Lo! those who ask leave of thee, those are they who believe in Allah and His messenger. So, if they ask thy leave for some affair of theirs, give leave to whom thou wilt of them, and ask for them forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. ^qPickthall2462


Those only are believers, who believe in God and His Messenger and who, when they are with him upon a common matter, go not away until they ask his leave. Surely those who ask thy leave -- those are they that believe in God and His Messenger; so, when they ask thy leave for some affair of their own, give leave to whom thou wilt of them, and ask God's forgiveness for them; surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate. ^qArberry2462

DO NOT regard the Apostles summons to you [in the same light] as a summons of one of you to another: God is indeed aware of those of you who would withdraw surreptitiously: so let those who would go against His bidding beware, lest a [bitter] trial befall them [in this world] or grievous suffering befall them [in the life to come]. ^qAsad2463


Make not the calling of the messenger among you as your calling one of another. Allah knoweth those of you who steal away, hiding themselves. And let those who conspire to evade orders beware lest grief or painful punishment befall them. ^qPickthall2463


Make not the calling of the Messenger among yourselves like your calling one of another. God knows those of you who slip away surreptitiously; so let those who go against His command beware, lest a trial befall them, or there befall them a painful chastisement. ^qArberry2463

Oh, verily, unto God belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: well does He know where you stand and at what you aim! And one Day, all [who have ever lived] will be brought back unto Him, and then He will make them [truly] understand all that they were doing [in life]: for, God has full knowledge of everything. ^qAsad2464


Lo! verily unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. He knoweth your condition. And (He knoweth) the Day when they are returned unto Him so that He may inform them of what they did. Allah is Knower of all things. ^qPickthall2464


Why, surely to God belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth; He ever knows what state you are upon; and the day when they shall be returned to Him, then He will tell them of what they did; and God knows everything. ^qArberry2464
