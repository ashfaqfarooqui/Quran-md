And how many a [rebellious] community have We destroyed, with Our punishment coming upon it by night, or while they were resting at noontide! ^qAsad63


How many a township have We destroyed! As a raid by night, or while they slept at noon, Our terror came unto them. ^qPickthall63

And when Our punishment came upon them, they had nothing to say for themselves, and could only cry, "Verily, we were wrongdoers!" ^qAsad64


No plea had they, when Our terror came unto them, save that they said: Lo! We were wrong-doers. ^qPickthall64

Falanas 'alannal lazeena ursila ilaihim wa lanas 'alannal mursaleen ^qTrans65


Thus, [on Judgment Day] We shall most certainly call to account all those unto whom a [divine] message was sent, and We shall most certainly call to account the message-bearers [themselves]; ^qAsad65


Then verily We shall question those unto whom (Our message) hath been sent, and verily We shall question the messengers. ^qPickthall65


So We shall question those unto whom a Message was sent, and We shall question the Envoys, ^qArberry65

Falanaqussanna 'alaihim bi'ilminw wa maa kunnaa ghaaa'ibeen ^qTrans66


and thereupon We shall most certainly reveal unto them Our knowledge [of their doings]: for never have We been absent [from them]. ^qAsad66


Then verily We shall narrate unto them (the event) with knowledge, for We were not absent (when it came to pass). ^qPickthall66


and We shall relate to them with knowledge; assuredly We were not absent. ^qArberry66

And true will be the weighing on that Day; and those whose weight [of good deeds] is heavy in the balance -it is they, they who shall attain to a happy state; ^qAsad67


The weighing on that day is the true (weighing). As for those whose scale is heavy, they are the successful. ^qPickthall67


The weighing that day is true; he whose scales are heavy -- they are the prosperers, ^qArberry67

YEA, INDEED, [O men,] We have given you a [bountiful] place on earth, and appointed thereon means of livelihood for you: [yet] how seldom are you grateful! ^qAsad69

Yea, indeed, We have created you, and then formed you; and then We said unto the angels, "Prostrate yourselves before Adam!" - whereupon they [all] prostrated themselves, save Iblis: he was not among those who prostrated themselves. ^qAsad610


And We created you, then fashioned you, then told the angels: Fall ye prostrate before Adam! And they fell prostrate, all save Iblis, who was not of those who make prostration. ^qPickthall610


We created you, then We shaped you, then We said to the angels: 'Bow yourselves to Adam'; so they bowed themselves, save Iblis -- he was not of those that bowed themselves. ^qArberry610

[And God] said: "What has kept thee from prostrating thyself when I commanded thee?" Answered [Iblis]: "I am better than he: Thou hast created me out of fire, whereas him Thou hast created out of clay." ^qAsad611


He said: What hindered thee that thou didst not fall prostrate when I bade thee? (Iblis) said: I am better than him. Thou createdst me of fire while him Thou didst create of mud. ^qPickthall611


Said He, 'What prevented thee to bow thyself, when I commanded thee?' Said he, 'I am better than he; Thou createdst me of fire, and him Thou createdst of clay.' ^qArberry611

[God] said: "Down with thee, then, from this [state] -for it is not meet for thee to show arrogance here! Go forth, then: verily, among the humiliated shalt thou be!" ^qAsad612


He said: Then go down hence! It is not for thee to show pride here, so go forth! Lo! thou art of those degraded. ^qPickthall612


Said He, 'Get thee down out of it; it is not for thee to wax proud here, so go thou forth; surely thou art among the humbled.' ^qArberry612

[Whereupon Iblis] said: "Now that Thou hast thwarted me," shall most certainly lie in ambush for them all along Thy straight way, ^qAsad615

and shall most certainly fall upon them openly as well as in a manner beyond their ken, and from their right and from their left: and most of them Thou wilt find ungrateful." ^qAsad616


Then I shall come upon them from before them and from behind them and from their right hands and from their left hands, and Thou wilt not find most of them beholden (unto Thee). ^qPickthall616


then I shall come on them from before them and from behind them, from their right hands and their left hands; Thou wilt not find most of them thankful.' ^qArberry616

[And God] said: "Go forth from here, disgraced and disowned! [And] as for such of them as follow thee - I will most certainly fill hell with you all! ^qAsad617

Said He, 'Go thou forth from it, despised and banished. Those of them that follow thee -- I shall assuredly fill Gehenna with all of you.' ^qArberry617

And [as for thee], O Adam', dwell thou and thy wife in this garden, and eat, both of you, whatever you may wish; but do not approach this one tree, lest you become evildoers!" ^qAsad618


And (unto man): O Adam! Dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden and eat from whence ye will, but come not nigh this tree lest ye become wrong-doers. ^qPickthall618


'O Adam, inherit, thou and thy wife, the Garden, and eat of where you will, but come not nigh this tree, lest you be of the evildoers.' ^qArberry618

Thereupon Satan whispered unto the two with a view to making them conscious of their nakedness, of which [hitherto] they had been unaware; and he said: "Your Sustainer has but forbidden you this tree lest you two become [as] angels, or lest you live forever." ^qAsad619


Then Satan whispered to them that he might manifest unto them that which was hidden from them of their shame, and he said: Your Lord forbade you from this tree only lest ye should become angels or become of the immortals. ^qPickthall619


Then Satan whispered to them, to reveal to them that which was hidden from them of their shameful parts. He said, 'Your Lord has only prohibited you from this tree lest you become angels, or lest you become immortals.' ^qArberry619

# 21

Wa qaasamahumaaa innee lakumaa laminan naasiheen ^qTrans620


And he swore unto them, "Verily, I am of those who wish you well indeed!" ^qAsad620


And he swore unto them (saying): Lo! I am a sincere adviser unto you. ^qPickthall620


And he swore to them, 'Truly, I am for you a sincere adviser.' ^qArberry620

-and thus he led them on with deluding thoughts. But as soon as the two had tasted [the fruit] of the tree, they became conscious of their nakedness; and they began to cover themselves with pieced-together leaves from the garden. And their Sustainer called unto them: "Did I not forbid that tree unto you and tell you, `Verily, Satan is your open foe'?" ^qAsad621


Thus did he lead them on with guile. And when they tasted of the tree their shame was manifest to them and they began to hide (by heaping) on themselves some of the leaves of the Garden. And their Lord called them, (saying): Did I not forbid you from that tree and tell you: Lo! Satan is an open enemy to you? ^qPickthall621


So he led them on by delusion; and when they tasted the tree, their shameful parts revealed to them, so they took to stitching upon themselves leaves of the Garden. And their Lord called to them, 'Did not I prohibit you from this tree, and say to you, "Verily Satan is for you a manifest foe"?' ^qArberry621

The two replied: "O our Sustainer! We have sinned against ourselves -and unless Thou grant us forgiveness and bestow Thy mercy upon us, we shall most certainly be lost!" ^qAsad622


They said: Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If thou forgive us not and have not mercy on us, surely we are of the lost! ^qPickthall622


They said, 'Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if Thou dost not forgive us, and have mercy upon us, we shall surely be among the lost.' ^qArberry622

Said He: "Down with you, [and be henceforth] enemies unto one another, having on earth your abode and livelihood for a while: ^qAsad623


He said: Go down (from hence), one of you a foe unto the other. There will be for you on earth a habitation and provision for a while. ^qPickthall623


Said He, 'Get you down, each of you an enemy to each. In the earth a sojourn shall be yours, and enjoyment for a time.' ^qArberry623

there shall you live" - He added - "and there shall you die, and thence shall you be brought forth [on Resurrection Day]! ^qAsad624


He said: There shall ye live, and there shall ye die, and thence shall ye be brought forth. ^qPickthall624


Said He, 'Therein you shall live, and therein you shall die, and from there you shall be brought forth.' ^qArberry624

O CHILDREN of Adam! Indeed, We have bestowed upon you from on high [the knowledge of making] garments to cover your nakedness, and as a thing of beauty: but the garment of God-consciousness is the best of all. Herein lies a message from God, so that man” might take it to heart. ^qAsad625


O Children of Adam! We have revealed unto you raiment to conceal your shame, and splendid vesture, but the raiment of restraint from evil, that is best. This is of the revelations of Allah, that they may remember. ^qPickthall625


Children of Adam! We have sent down on you a garment to cover your shameful parts, and feathers; and the garment of godfearing -- that is better; that is one of God's signs; haply they will remember. ^qArberry625

# 27

O children of Adam! Do not allow Satan to seduce you in the same way as he caused your ancestors to be driven out of the garden: he deprived them of their garment [of God-consciousness] in order to make them aware of their nakedness. Verily, he and his tribe are lying in wait for you where you cannot perceive them! Verily, We have placed [all manner of] satanic forces near unto those who do not [truly] believe; ^qAsad626


O Children of Adam! Let not Satan seduce you as he caused your (first) parents to go forth from the Garden and tore off from them their robe (of innocence) that he might manifest their shame to them. Lo! he seeth you, he and his tribe, from whence ye see him not. Lo! We have made the devils protecting friends for those who believe not. ^qPickthall626


Children of Adam! Let not Satan tempt you as he brought your parents out of the Garden, stripping them of their garments to show them their shameful parts. Surely he sees you, he and his tribe, from where you see them not. We have made the Satans the friends of those who do not believe. ^qArberry626

and [so,] whenever they commit a shameful deed, they are wont to say, "We found our forefathers doing it," and, "God has enjoined it upon us." Say: "Behold, never does God enjoin deeds of abomination. Would you attribute unto God something of which you have no knowledge?" ^qAsad627


And when they do some lewdness they say: We found our fathers doing it and Allah hath enjoined it on us. Say: Allah, verily, enjoineth not lewdness. Tell ye concerning Allah that which ye know not? ^qPickthall627


And whenever they commit an indecency they say, 'We found our fathers practising it, and God has commanded us to do it.' Say: 'God does not command indecency; what, do you say concerning God such things as you know not?' ^qArberry627

Qul amara Rabbee bilqisti wa aqeemoo wujoohakum 'inda kulli masjidin wad'oohu mukhliseena lahud deen; kamaa bada akum ta'oodoon ^qTrans628


Say: "My Sustainer has [but] enjoined the doing of what is right; and [He desires you to] put your whole being into every act of worship, and to call unto Him, sincere in your faith in Him alone. As it was He who brought you into being in the first instance, so also [unto Him] you will return: ^qAsad628


Say: My Lord enjoineth justice. And set your faces upright (toward Him) at every place of worship and call upon Him, making religion pure for Him (only). As He brought you into being, so return ye (unto Him). ^qPickthall628


Say: 'My Lord has commanded justice. Set your faces in every place of worship and call on Him, making your religion sincerely His. As He originated you so you will return; ^qArberry628

some [of you] He will have graced with His guidance, whereas, for some a straying from the right path will have become unavoidable: for, behold, they will have taken [their own] evil impulses for their masters in preference to God, thinking all the while that they have found the right path!" ^qAsad629


A party hath He led aright, while error hath just hold over (another) party, for lo! they choose the devils for protecting supporters instead of Allah and deem that they are rightly guided. ^qPickthall629


a part He guided, and a part justly disposed to error -- they have taken Satans for friends instead of God, and think them guided.' ^qArberry629

O CHILDREN of Adam! Beautify yourselves for every act of worship, and eat and drink [freely], but do not waste: verily, He does not love the wasteful! ^qAsad630


O Children of Adam! Look to your adornment at every place of worship, and eat and drink, but be not prodigal. Lo! He loveth not the prodigals. ^qPickthall630


Children of Adam! Take your adornment at every place of worship; and eat and drink, but be you not prodigal; He loves not the prodigal. ^qArberry630

Say: "Who is there to forbid the beauty which God has brought forth for His creatures, and the good things from among the means of sustenance?" Say: "They are [lawful] in the life of this world unto all who have attained to faith - to be theirs alone on Resurrection Day." Thus clearly do We spell out these messages unto people of [innate] knowledge! ^qAsad631


Say: Who hath forbidden the adornment of Allah which He hath brought forth for His bondmen, and the good things of His providing? Say: Such, on the Day of Resurrection, will be only for those who believed during the life of the world. Thus do we detail Our revelations for people who have knowledge. ^qPickthall631


Say: 'Who has forbidden the ornament of God which He brought forth for His servants, and the good things of His providing?' Say: 'These, on the Day of Resurrection, shall be exclusively for those who believed in this present life. So We distinguish the signs for a people who know.' ^qArberry631

Say: "Verily, my Sustainer has forbidden only shameful deeds, be they open or secret, and [every kind of] sinning, and unjustified envy, and the ascribing of divinity to aught beside Him - since He has never bestowed any warrant therefor from on high and the attributing unto God of aught of which you have no knowledge." ^qAsad632


Say: My Lord forbiddeth only indecencies, such of them as are apparent and such as are within, and sin and wrongful oppression, and that ye associate with Allah that for which no warrant hath been revealed, and that ye tell concerning Allah that which ye know not. ^qPickthall632


Say: 'My Lord has only forbidden indecencies, the inward and the outward, and sin, and unjust insolence, and that you associate with God that for which He sent down never authority, and that you say concerning God such as you know not. ^qArberry632

And for all people a term has been set: and when [the end of] their term approaches, they can neither delay it by a single moment, nor can they hasten it. ^qAsad633


And every nation hath its term, and when its term cometh, they cannot put it off an hour nor yet advance (it). ^qPickthall633


To every nation a term; when their term comes they shall not put it back by a single hour nor put it forward. ^qArberry633

O CHILDREN of Adam! Whenever there come unto you apostles of your own, conveying My messages unto you, then all who are conscious of Me and live righteously - no fear need they have, and neither shall they grieve; ^qAsad634


O Children of Adam! When messengers of your own come unto you who narrate unto you My revelations, then whosoever refraineth from evil and amendeth - there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. ^qPickthall634


Children of Adam! If there should come to you Messengers from among you, relating to you My signs, then whosoever is godfearing and makes amends -- no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow. ^qArberry634

but they who give the lie to Our messages and scorn them in their pride-these are destined for the fire, therein to abide. ^qAsad635


But they who deny Our revelations and scorn them - each are rightful owners of the Fire; they will abide therein. ^qPickthall635


And those that cry lies to Our signs, and wax proud against them -- those shall be the inhabitants of the Fire, therein dwelling forever. ^qArberry635

And who could be more wicked than they who attribute their own lying inventions to God or give the lie to His messages? Whatever has been decreed to be their lot [in life] will be theirs -till there shall come _ unto them Our messengers to cause them to die, [and] shall say, "Where, now, are those beings whom you were wont to invoke beside God?" And [those sinners] will reply, "They have forsaken us!" -and [thus] they will bear witness against themselves that they had been denying the truth. ^qAsad636


Who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah or denieth Our tokens.
