VERILY, [O Muhammad,] We have laid open before thee a manifest victory, ^qAsad481


Lo! We have given thee (O Muhammad) a signal victory, ^qPickthall481

Liyaghfira lakal laahu maa taqaddama min zambika wa maa ta akhkhara wa yutimma ni'matahoo 'alaika wa yahdiyaka siraatam mustaqeema ^qTrans482


so that God might show His forgiveness of all thy faults, past as well as future, and [thus] bestow upon thee the full measure of His blessings, and guide thee on a straight way, ^qAsad482


That Allah may forgive thee of thy sin that which is past and that which is to come, and may perfect His favour unto thee, and may guide thee on a right path, ^qPickthall482

Huwal lazeee anzalas sakeenata fee quloobil mu'mineena liyazdaadooo eemaanamma'a eemaanihim; wa lillaahi junoodus samawaati wal ard; wa kaanal laahu 'Aleeman Hakeemaa ^qTrans484


It is He who from on high has bestowed inner peace upon the hearts of the believers, so that - seeing that God’s are all the forces of the heavens and the earth, and that God is all-knowing, truly wise - they might grow yet more firm in their faith; ^qAsad484


He it is Who sent down peace of reassurance into the hearts of the believers that they might add faith unto their faith. Allah's are the hosts of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is ever Knower, Wise - ^qPickthall484


It is He who sent down the Shechina (tranquillity) into the hearts of the believers, that they might add faith to their faith -- to God belong the hosts of the heavens and the earth; God is All-knowing, All-wise -- ^qArberry484

[and] that He might admit the believers, both men and women, into gardens through which running waters flow, therein to abide, and that He might efface their [past bad] deeds: and that is, in the sight of God, indeed a triumph supreme! ^qAsad485


That He may bring the believing men and the believing women into Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide, and may remit from them their evil deeds - That, in the sight of Allah, is the supreme triumph - ^qPickthall485


and that He may admit the believers, men and women alike, into gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein to dwell forever, and acquit them of their evil deeds; that is in God's sight a mighty triumph; ^qArberry485

Wa yu'azzibal munaafiqeena walmunaafiqaati wal mushrikeena walmushrikaatiz zaaanneena billaahi zannas saw'; 'alaihim daaa'iratus saw'i wa ghadibal laahu 'alaihim wa la'anahum wa a'adda lahum jahannama wa saaa' at maseeraa ^qTrans486


And [God has willed] to impose suffering [in the life to come] on the hypocrites, both men and women, and on those who ascribe divinity to aught beside Him, both men and women: all who entertain evil thoughts about God. Evil encompasses them from all sides, and God’s condemnation rests upon them; and He has rejected them [from His grace], and has readied hell for them: and how evil a journey’s end! ^qAsad486


And may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women, and the idolatrous men and the idolatrous women, who think an evil thought concerning Allah. For them is the evil turn of fortune, and Allah is wroth against them and hath cursed them, and hath made ready for them hell, a hapless journey's end. ^qPickthall486


and that He may chastise the hypocrites, men and women alike, and the idolaters men and women alike, and those who think evil thoughts of God; against them shall be the evil turn of fortune. God is wroth with them, and has cursed them, and has prepared for them Gehenna -- an evil homecoming! ^qArberry486

Wa lillaahi junoodus samaawaati wal ard; wa kaanal laahu 'azeezan hakeema ^qTrans487


For, God’s are all the forces of the heavens and the earth; and God is indeed almighty, truly wise! ^qAsad487


Allah's are the hosts of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. ^qPickthall487


To God belong the hosts of the heavens and the earth; God is All-mighty, All-wise. ^qArberry487

Innaaa arsalnaaka shaahi danw wa mubashshiranw wa nazeera ^qTrans488


VERILY, [O Muhammad,] We have sent thee as a witness [to the truth], and as a herald of glad tidings and a warner – ^qAsad488


Lo! We have sent thee (O Muhammad) as a witness and a bearer of good tidings and a warner, ^qPickthall488

Litu minoo billaahi wa Rasoolihee wa tu'azziroohu watuwaqqiroohu watusabbi hoohu bukratanw wa aseelaa ^qTrans489


so that you [O men] might believe in God and His Apostle, and might honour Him, and revere Him, and extol His limitless glory from morn to evening. ^qAsad489


That ye (mankind) may believe in Allah and His messenger, and may honour Him, and may revere Him, and may glorify Him at early dawn and at the close of day. ^qPickthall489


that you may believe in God and His Messenger and succour Him, and reverence Him, and that you may give Him glory at the dawn and in the evening. ^qArberry489

Behold, all who pledge their allegiance to thee pledge their allegiance to God: the hand of God is over their hands. Hence, he who breaks his oath, breaks it only to his own hurt; whereas he who remains true to what he has pledged unto God, on him will He bestow a reward supreme. ^qAsad4810


Lo! those who swear allegiance unto thee (Muhammad), swear allegiance only unto Allah. The Hand of Allah is above their hands. So whosoever breaketh his oath, breaketh it only to his soul's hurt; while whosoever keepeth his covenant with Allah, on him will He bestow immense reward. ^qPickthall4810


Those who swear fealty to thee swear fealty in truth to God; God's hand is over their hands. Then whosoever breaks his oath breaks it but to his own hurt; and whoso fulfils his covenant made with God, God will give him a mighty wage. ^qArberry4810

Those of the bedouin who stayed behind will say unto thee: “[The need to take care of] our chat­tels and our families kept us busy: do then, [O Prophet,] ask God to forgive us!” [Thus,] they will utter with their tongues something that is not in their hearts. Say: “Who, then, has it in his power to avert from you aught that God may have willed, whether it be His will to harm you or to confer a benefit on you? Nay, but God is fully aware of what you do! ^qAsad4811


Those of the wandering Arabs who were left behind will tell thee: Our possessions and our households occupied us, so ask forgiveness for us! They speak with their tongues that which is not in their hearts. Say: Who can avail you aught against Allah, if He intend you hurt or intend you profit? Nay, but Allah is ever Aware of what ye do. ^qPickthall4811


The Bedouins who were left behind will say to thee, 'We were occupied by our possessions and our families; so ask forgiveness for us!' They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: 'Who can avail you aught against God, if He desires hurt for you, or desires profit for you? Nay, but God is ever aware of the things you do. ^qArberry4811

Bal zanantum al lany yanqalibar Rasoolu walmu'minoona ilaaa ahleehim abadanw wa zuyyina zaalika fee quloobikum wa zanantum zannnas saw'i wa kuntum qawmam booraa ^qTrans4812


Nay, you thought that the Apostle and the believers would never return to their kith and kin: and this seemed goodly to your hearts. And you entertained [such] evil thoughts because you have always been people devoid of all good!” ^qAsad4812


Nay, but ye deemed that the messenger and the believers would never return to their own folk, and that was made fairseeming in your hearts, and ye did think an evil thought, and ye were worthless folk. ^qPickthall4812


Nay, but you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families, and that was decked out fair in your hearts, and you thought evil thoughts, and you were a people corrupt.' ^qArberry4812

# 13

Wa mal lam yu'mim billaahi wa Rasoolihee fainnaaa a'tadnaa lilkaafireena sa'eeraa ^qTrans4813


Now as for those who will not believe in God and His Apostle - verily, We have readied a blazing flame for all [such] deniers of the truth! ^qAsad4813


And so for him who believeth not in Allah and His messenger - Lo! We have prepared a flame for disbelievers. ^qPickthall4813


Whoso believes not in God and His Messenger, We have prepared for the unbelievers a Blaze. ^qArberry4813

# 14

Wa lillaahii mulkus samaawaati wal ard; yaghfiru limany yashaaa'u wa yu'azzibu many yashaaa'; wa kaanal laahu Ghafoorar Raheemaa ^qTrans4814


But God’s is the dominion over the heavens and the earth: He forgives whomever He wills, and imposes suffering on whomever He wills - and [withal,] He is indeed much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace. ^qAsad4814


And Allah's is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He forgiveth whom He will, and punisheth whom He will. And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. ^qPickthall4814


To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth; whomsoever He will He forgives, and whomsoever He will He chastises; God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate. ^qArberry4814

# 15

Sa yaqoolul mukhalla foona izan talaqtum ilaa maghaanima litaakhuzoohaa zaroonaa nattabi'kum yureedoona any yubaddiloo Kalaamallaah; qul lan tattabi'oonaa kazaalikum qaalal laahu min qablu fasa yaqooloona bal tahsudoonanna; bal kaanoo laa yafqahoona illaa qaleela ^qTrans4815


As soon as you [O believers] are about to set forth on a war that promises booty, those who stayed behind [aforetime] will surely say, “Allow us to go with you” - [thus showing that] they would like to alter the Word of God. Say: “By no means shall you go with us: God has declared aforetime [to whom all spoils shall belong].” Thereupon they will [surely] answer, “Nay, but you begrudge us [our share of booty]!” Nay, they can grasp but so little of the truth! ^qAsad4815


Those who were left behind will say, when ye set forth to capture booty: Let us go with you. They fain would change the verdict of Allah. Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Ye shall not go with us. Thus hath Allah said beforehand. Then they will say: Ye are envious of us. Nay, but they understand not, save a little. ^qPickthall4815


The Bedouins who were left behind will say, when you set forth after spoils, to take them, 'Let us follow you,' desiring to change God's words. Say: 'You shall not follow us; so God said before.' Then they will say, 'Nay, but you' are jealous of us.' Nay, but they have not understood except a little. ^qArberry4815

Qul lilmukhallafeena minal A'raabi satud'awna ilaa qawmin ulee baasin shadeedin tuqaati loonahum aw yuslimoona fa in tutee'oo yu'tikumul laahu ajran hasananw wa in tatawallaw kamaa tawallaitum min qablu yu'azzibkum 'azaaban aleemaa ^qTrans4816


Say unto those bedouin who stayed behind: “In time you will be called upon [to fight] against people of great prowess in war: you will have to fight against them [until you die] or they surrender. And then, if you heed [that call], God will bestow on you a goodly reward; but if you turn away as you turned away this time, He will chastise you with grievous chastisement.” ^qAsad4816


Say unto those of the wandering Arabs who were left behind: Ye will be called against a folk of mighty prowess, to fight them until they surrender; and if ye obey, Allah will give you a fair reward; but if ye turn away as ye did turn away before, He will punish you with a painful doom. ^qPickthall4816


Say to the Bedouins who were left behind: 'You shall be called against a people possessed of great might' to fight them, or they surrender. If you obey, God will give you a goodly wage; but if you turn your backs, as you turned your backs before, He will chastise you with a painful chastisement.' ^qArberry4816

No blame attaches to the blind, nor does blame attach to the lame, nor does blame attach to the sick [for staying away from a war in God’s cause]; but whoever heeds [the call of] God and His Apostle [in deed or in heart], him will He admit into gardens through which running waters flow; whereas him who turns away will He chastise with grievous chastise­ment. ^qAsad4817


There is no blame for the blind, nor is there blame for the lame, nor is there blame for the sick (that they go not forth to war). And whoso obeyeth Allah and His messenger, He will make him enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow; and whoso turneth back, him will He punish with a painful doom. ^qPickthall4817


There is no fault in the blind, and there is no fault in the lame, and there is no fault in the sick. And whosoever obeys God and His Messenger, He will admit him into gardens underneath which rivers flow; but whosoever turns his back, him He will chastise with a painful chastisement. ^qArberry4817

INDEED, well-pleased was God with the believers when they pledged their allegiance unto thee [O Muhammad] under that tree, for He knew what was in their hearts; and so He bestowed inner peace upon them from on high, and rewarded them with [the glad tiding of] a victory soon to come ^qAsad4818


Allah was well pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance unto thee beneath the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down peace of reassurance on them, and hath rewarded them with a near victory; ^qPickthall4818


God was well pleased with the believers when they were swearing fealty to thee under the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down the Shechina upon them, and rewarded them with a nigh victory ^qArberry4818

Wa maghaanima kaseera tany yaakhuzoonahaa; wa kaanal laahu 'Azeezan Hakeemaa ^qTrans4819


and [of] many war-gains which they would achieve: for God is indeed almighty, wise. ^qAsad4819


And much booty that they will capture. Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. ^qPickthall4819


and many spoils to take; and God is ever All-mighty, All-wise. ^qArberry4819

# 20

[O you who believe!] God has promised you many war-gains which you shall yet achieve; and He has vouchsafed you these [worldly gains] well in advance, and has stayed from you the hands of [hostile] people, so that this [your inner strength] may become a symbol to the believers [who will come after you], and that He may guide you all on a straight way. ^qAsad4820


Allah promiseth you much booty that ye will capture, and hath given you this in advance, and hath withheld men's hands from you, that it may be a token for the believers, and that He may guide you on a right path. ^qPickthall4820


God has promised you many spoils to take; these He has hastened to you, and has restrained the hands of men from you, and that it may be a sign to the believers, and to guide you on a straight path, ^qArberry4820

# 21

Wa ukhraa lam taqdiroo 'alaihaa qad ahaatal laahu bihaa; wa kaanal laahu 'alaa kulli shai'in qadeera ^qTrans4821


And there are yet other [gains] which are still beyond your grasp, [but] which God has already encompassed [for you]: for God has the power to will anything. ^qAsad4821


And other (gain), which ye have not been able to achieve, Allah will compass it, Allah is Able to do all things. ^qPickthall4821


and other spoils you were not able to take; God had encompassed them already. God is powerful over everything. ^qArberry4821

# 22

Wa law qaatalakumul lazeena kafaroo la wallawul adbaara summa laa yajidoona waliyanw-wa laa naseeraa ^qTrans4822


And [now,] if they who are bent on denying the truth should fight against you, they will indeed turn their backs [in flight], and will find none to protect them and none to bring them succour: ^qAsad4822


And if those who disbelieve join battle with you they will take to flight, and afterward they will find no protecting friend nor helper. ^qPickthall4822


If the unbelievers had fought you, they would have turned their backs, and then found neither protector nor helper; ^qArberry4822

# 23

such being God’s way which has ever obtained in the past - and never wilt thou find any change in God’s way! ^qAsad4823


It is the law of Allah which hath taken course aforetime. Thou wilt not find for the law of Allah aught of power to change. ^qPickthall4823


the wont of God, as in the past before, and thou shalt never find any changing the wont of God. ^qArberry4823

Wa Huwal lazee kaffa aydiyahum 'ankum wa aydiyakum 'anhum bibatni Makkata mim ba'di an azfarakum 'alaihim; wa kaanal laahu bimaa ta'maloona Baseera ^qTrans4824


And He it is who, in the valley of Mecca, stayed their hands from you, and your hands from them, after He had enabled you to vanquish them; and God saw indeed what you were doing. ^qAsad4824


And He it is Who hath withheld men's hands from you, and hath withheld your hands from them, in the valley of Mecca, after He had made you victors over them. Allah is Seer of what ye do. ^qPickthall4824


It is He who restrained their hands from you, and your hands from them, in the hollow of Mecca, after that He made you victors over them. God sees the things you do. ^qArberry4824

[It was not for your enemies sake that He stayed your hands from them: for] it was they who were bent on denying the truth, and who debarred you from the Inviolable House of Worship and prevented your offering from reaching its destina­tion. And had it not been for the believing men and believing women [in Mecca], whom you might have unwittingly trampled underfoot, and on whose account you might have become guilty, without knowing it, of a grievous wrong-: [had it not been for this, you would have been allowed to fight your way into the city: but you were forbidden to fight] so that [in time] God might admit to His grace whomever He wills. Had they [who deserve Our mercy and they whom We have condemned] been clearly discernible [to you], We would indeed have imposed grievous suffering [at your hands] on such of them as were bent on denying the truth. ^qAsad4825


These it was who disbelieved and debarred you from the Inviolable Place of Worship, and debarred the offering from reaching its goal. And if it had not been for believing men and believing women, whom ye know not - lest ye should tread them under foot and thus incur guilt for them unknowingly; that Allah might bring into His mercy whom He will - If (the believers and the disbelievers) had been clearly separated We verily had punished those of them who disbelieved with painful punishment. ^qPickthall4825


They are the ones who disbelieved, and barred you from the Holy Mosque and the offering, detained so as not to reach its place of sacrifice. If it had not been for certain men believers and certain women believers whom you knew not, lest you should trample them, and there befall you guilt unwittingly on their account (that God may admit into His mercy whom He will), had they been separated clearly, then We would have chastised the unbelievers among them with a painful chastisement. ^qArberry4825

Whereas they who are bent on denying the truth harboured a stubborn disdain in their hearts - the stubborn disdain [born] of ignorance God bestowed from on high His [gift of] inner peace upon His Apostle and the believers, and bound them to the spirit of God-consciousness: for they were most worthy of this [divine gift], and deserved it well. And God has full knowledge of all things. ^qAsad4826


When those who disbelieve had set up in their hearts zealotry, the zealotry of the Age of Ignorance, then Allah sent down His peace of reassurance upon His messenger and upon the believers and imposed on them the word of self-restraint, for they were worthy of it and meet for it. And Allah is Aware of all things. ^qPickthall4826


When the unbelievers set in their hearts fierceness, the fierceness of pagandom, then God sent down His Shechina upon His Messenger and the believers, and fastened to them the word of godfearing to which they have better right and are worthy of; and God has' knowledge of everything. ^qArberry4826

Indeed, God has shown the truth in His Apostle’s true vision: most certainly shall you enter the Inviolable House of Worship, if God so wills, in full security, with your heads shaved or your hair cut short, without any fear: for He has [always] known that which you yourselves could not know. And He has ordained [for you], besides this, a victory soon to come. ^qAsad4827


Allah hath fulfilled the vision for His messenger in very truth. Ye shall indeed enter the Inviolable Place of Worship, if Allah will, secure, (having your hair) shaven and cut, not fearing. But He knoweth that which ye know not, and hath given you a near victory beforehand. ^qPickthall4827


God has indeed fulfilled the vision He vouchsafed to His Messenger truly: 'You shall enter the Holy Mosque, if God wills, in security, your heads shaved, your hair cut short, not fearing.' He knew what you knew not, and appointed ere that a nigh victory. ^qArberry4827

He it is who has sent forth His Apostle with the [task of spreading] guidance and the religion of truth, to the end that He make it prevail over every [false] religion; and none can bear witness [to the truth] as God does. ^qAsad4828


He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religion. And Allah sufficeth as a Witness. ^qPickthall4828


It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, that He may uplift it above every religion. God suffices as a witness. ^qArberry4828

MUHAMMAD is God’s Apostle; and those who are [truly] with him are firm and unyielding towards all deniers of the truth, [yet] full of mercy towards one another. Thou canst see them bowing down, pros­trating themselves [in prayer], seeking favour with God and [His] goodly acceptance: their marks are on their faces, traced by prostration. This is their parable in the Torah as well as their parable in the Gospel: [they are] like a seed that brings forth its shoot, and then He strengthens it, so that it grows stout, and [in the end] stands firm upon its stem, delighting the sowers. [Thus will God cause the believers to grow in strength,] so that through them He might confound the deniers of the truth. [But] unto such of them as may [yet] attain to faith and do righteous deeds, God has promised forgiveness and a reward supreme. ^qAsad4829


Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. And those with him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful among themselves. Thou (O Muhammad) seest them bowing and falling prostrate (in worship), seeking bounty from Allah and (His) acceptance. The mark of them is on their foreheads from the traces of prostration. Such is their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in the Gospel - like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot and strengtheneth it and riseth firm upon its stalk, delighting the sowers - that He may enrage the disbelievers with (the sight of) them. Allah hath promised, unto such of them as believe and do good works, forgiveness and immense reward. ^qPickthall4829


Muhammad is the Messenger of God, and those who are with him are hard against the unbelievers, merciful one to another. Thou seest them bowing, prostrating, seeking bounty from God and good pleasure. Their mark is on their faces, the trace of prostration. That is their likeness in the Torah, and their likeness in the Gospel: as a seed that puts forth its shoot, and strengthens it, and it grows stout and rises straight upon its stalk, pleasing the sowers, that through them He may enrage the unbelievers. God has promised those of them who believe and do deeds of righteousness forgiveness and a mighty wage. ^qArberry4829
