Yaa aiyuhan Nabiyyut taqil laaha wa laa tuti'il kaafireena wal munaafiqeen; innal laaha kaana 'aleeman Hakeemaa ^qTrans331


PROPHET! Remain conscious of God, and defer not to the deniers of the truth and the hypo­crites: for God is truly all-knowing, wise. ^qAsad331


O Prophet! Keep thy duty to Allah and obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Lo! Allah is Knower, Wise. ^qPickthall331


O Prophet, fear God, and obey not the unbelievers and the hypocrites. God is All-knowing, All-wise. ^qArberry331

# 2

Wattabi' maa yoohaaa ilaika mir Rabbik; innal laaha kaana bimaa ta'maloona Khabeera ^qTrans332


And follow [but] that which comes unto thee through revelation from thy Sustainer: for God is truly aware of all that you do, [O men]. ^qAsad332


And follow that which is inspired in thee from thy Lord. Lo! Allah is Aware of what ye do. ^qPickthall332


And follow what is revealed to thee from thy Lord; surely God is aware of the things you do. ^qArberry332

# 3

Wa tawakkal 'alal laah; wa kafaa billaahi Wakeelaa ^qTrans333


And place thy trust in God [alone]: for none is as worthy of trust as God. ^qAsad333


And put thy trust in Allah, for Allah is sufficient as Trustee. ^qPickthall333


And put thy trust in God; God suffices as a guardian. ^qArberry333

Maa ja'alal laahu lirajulim min qalbaini fee jawfih; wa maa ja'ala azwaajakumul laaa'ee tuzaahiroona minhunna ummahaatikum; wa maa ja'ala ad'iyaaa'akum abnaaa'akum; zaalikum qawlukum bi afwaa hikum wallaahu yaqoolul haqqa wa Huwa yahdis sabeel ^qTrans334


NEVER has God endowed any man with two hearts in one body: and [just as] He has never made your wives whom you may have declared to be “as unlawful to you as your mothers’ bodies” [truly] your mothers, so, too, has He never made your adopted sons [truly] your sons: these are but [figures of] speech uttered by your mouths - whereas God speaks the [absolute] truth: and it is He alone who can show [you] the right path. ^qAsad334


Allah hath not assigned unto any man two hearts within his body, nor hath He made your wives whom ye declare (to be your mothers) your mothers, nor hath He made those whom ye claim (to be your sons) your sons. This is but a saying of your mouths. But Allah saith the truth and He showeth the way. ^qPickthall334


God has not assigned to any man two hearts within his breast; nor has He made your wives, when you divorce, saying, 'Be as my mother's back,' truly your mothers, neither has He made your adopted sons your sons in fact. That is your own saying, the words of your mouths; but God speaks the truth, and guides on the way. ^qArberry334

Ud'oohum li aabaaa'ihim huwa aqsatu 'indal laah; fa illam ta'lamooo aabaaa'ahum fa ikhwaanukum fid deeni wa mawaaleekum; wa laisa 'alaikum junaahun feemaaa akhtaatum bihee wa laakim maa ta'ammadat quloobukum; wa kaanal laahu Ghafoorar Raheemaa ^qTrans335


[As for your adopted children,] call them by their [real] fathers’ names: this is more equitable in the sight of God; and if you know not who their fathers were, [call them] your brethren in faith and your friends. However, you will incur no sin if you err in this respect: [what really matters is] but what your hearts intend - for God is indeed much-forgiv­ing, a dispenser of grace! ^qAsad335


Proclaim their real parentage. That will be more equitable in the sight of Allah. And if ye know not their fathers, then (they are) your brethren in the faith, and your clients. And there is no sin for you in the mistakes that ye make unintentionally, but what your hearts purpose (that will be a sin for you). Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. ^qPickthall335


Call them after their true fathers; that is more equitable in the sight of God. If you know not who their fathers were, then they are your brothers in religion, and your clients. There is no fault in you if you make mistakes, but only in what your hearts premeditate. God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate. ^qArberry335

An-Nabiyyu awlaa bil mu'mineena min anfusihim wa azwaajuhoo ummahatuhum wa ulul arbaami ba'duhum awlaa biba'din fee Kitaabil laahi minal mu'meneena wal Muhaajireena illaaa an taf'alooo ilaaa awliyaaa'ikum ma'roofaa; kaana zaalika fil kitaabi mastooraa ^qTrans336


The Prophet has a higher claim on the believers than [they have on] their own selves, [seeing that he is as a father to them] and his wives are their mothers: and they who are [thus] closely related have, in accordance with God’s decree, a higher claim upon one another than [was even the case between] the believers [of Yathrib] and those who had migrated [there for the sake of God]. None the less, you are to act with utmost goodness towards your [other] close friends as well: this [too] is written down in God’s decree. ^qAsad336


The Prophet is closer to the believers than their selves, and his wives are (as) their mothers. And the owners of kinship are closer one to another in the ordinance of Allah than (other) believers and the fugitives (who fled from Mecca), except that ye should do kindness to your friends. This is written in the Book (of nature). ^qPickthall336


The Prophet is nearer to the believers than their selves; his wives are their mothers. Those who are bound by blood are nearer to one another in the Book of God than the believers and the emigrants; nevertheless you should act towards your friends honourably; that stands inscribed in the Book. ^qArberry336

Wa iz akhaznaa minan Nabiyyeena meesaaqahum wa minka wa min Noohinw wa Ibraaheema wa Moosaa wa Eesab-ni-Maryama wa akhaznaa minhum meesaaqan ghaleezaa ^qTrans337


AND LO! We did accept a solemn pledge from all the prophets from thee, [O Muhammad,] as well as from Noah, and Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary -: for We accepted a most weighty, solemn pledge from [all of] them, ^qAsad337


And when We exacted a covenant from the prophets, and from thee (O Muhammad) and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus son of Mary. We took from them a solemn covenant; ^qPickthall337


And when We took compact from the Prophets, and from thee, and from Noah, and Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, Mary's son; We took from them a solemn compact, ^qArberry337

# 8

Liyas'alas saadiqeena 'an sidqihim; wa a'adda lilkaa fireena 'azaaban aleemaa ^qTrans338


so that [at the end of time] He might ask those men of truth as to [what response] their truthfulness [had received on earth]. And grievous suffering has He readied for all who deny the truth! ^qAsad338


That He may ask the loyal of their loyalty. And He hath prepared a painful doom for the unfaithful. ^qPickthall338


that He might question the truthful concerning their truthfulness; and He has prepared for the unbelievers a painful chastisement. ^qArberry338

Yaaa aiyuhal lazeena aamanuz kuroo ni'matal laahi 'alaikum iz jaaa'atkm junoodun fa arsalnaa 'alaihim reehanw wa junoodal lam tarawhaa; wa kaanal laahu bimaa ta'maloona Baseera ^qTrans339


O YOU who have attained to faith! Call to mind the blessings which God bestowed on you (at the time) when [enemy] hosts came down upon you, where­upon We let loose against them a storm wind and [heavenly] hosts that you could not see: yet God saw all that you did. ^qAsad339


O ye who believe! Remember Allah's favour unto you when there came against you hosts, and We sent against them a great wind and hosts ye could not see. And Allah is ever Seer of what ye do. ^qPickthall339


O believers, remember God's blessing upon you when hosts came against you, and We loosed against them a wind, and hosts you saw not; and God sees the things you do. ^qArberry339

Iz jaaa'ookum min fawqikum wa min asfala minkum wa iz zaaghatil absaaru wa balaghatil quloobul hanaajira wa tazunnoona billaahiz zunoonaa ^qTrans3310


[Remember what you felt] when they came upon you from above you and from below you, and when [your] eyes became dim and [your] hearts came up to [your] throats, and [when] most conflicting thoughts about God passed through your minds: ^qAsad3310


When they came upon you from above you and from below you, and when eyes grew wild and hearts reached to the throats, and ye were imagining vain thoughts concerning Allah. ^qPickthall3310


When they came against you from above you and from below you, and when your eyes swerved and your hearts reached your throats, while you thought thoughts about God; ^qArberry3310

# 11

Hunaalikab tuliyal mu'minoona wa zulziloo zilzaalan shadeedaa ^qTrans3311


[for] there and then were the believers tried, and shaken with a shock severe. ^qAsad3311


There were the believers sorely tried, and shaken with a mighty shock. ^qPickthall3311


there it was that the believers were tried, and shaken most mightily. ^qArberry3311

# 12

Wa iz yaqoolul munaafiqoona wallazeena fee quloobihim maradum maa wa'adanal laahu wa Rasooluhooo illaa ghurooraa ^qTrans3312


And [remember how it was] when the hypo­crites and those with hearts diseased said [to one another], “God and His Apostle have promised us nothing but delusions!” ^qAsad3312


And when the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, were saying: Allah and His messenger promised us naught but delusion. ^qPickthall3312


And when tile hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is sickness, said, 'God and His Messenger promised us only delusion.' ^qArberry3312

Wa iz qaalat taaa'ifatum minhum yaaa ahla Yasriba laa muqaamaa lakum farji'oo; wa yastaazina fareequm minhumun Nabiyya yaqooloona inna buyootanaa 'awrah; wa maa hiya bi'awratin iny yureedoona illaa firaaraa ^qTrans3313


and when some of them said, “O you people of Yathrib! You cannot withstand [the enemy] here: hence, go back [to your homes]!” — Whereupon a party from among them asked leave of the Prophet, saying, “Behold, our houses are exposed [to attack]!” — The while they were not [really] exposed: they wanted nothing but to flee. ^qAsad3313


And when a party of them said: O folk of Yathrib! There is no stand (possible) for you, therefor turn back. And certain of them (even) sought permission of the Prophet, saying: Our homes lie open (to the enemy). And they lay not open. They but wished to flee. ^qPickthall3313


And when a party of them said, 'O people of Yathrib, there is no abiding here for you, therefore return!' And a part of them Were asking leave of the Prophet, saying, 'Our houses are exposed'; yet they were not exposed; they desired only to flee. ^qArberry3313

# 14

wa law dukhilat 'alaihim min aqtaarihaa summa su'ilul fitnata la aatawhaa wa maa talabbasoo bihaaa illaa yaseeraa ^qTrans3314


Now if their town had been stormed, and they had been asked [by the enemy] to commit apos­tasy, [the hypocrites] would have done so without much delay ^qAsad3314


If the enemy had entered from all sides and they had been exhorted to treachery, they would have committed it, and would have hesitated thereupon but little. ^qPickthall3314


And if entrance had been forced against them from those quarters, and then they had been asked to apostatise, they would have done so, and but tarried about it briefly. ^qArberry3314

# 15

Wa laqad kaanoo 'aahadul laaha min qablu laa yuwal loonal adbaar; wa kaana 'ahdul laahi mas'oolaa ^qTrans3315


although ere that they had vowed before God that they would never turn their backs [on His message]: and a vow made to God must surely be answered for! ^qAsad3315


And verily they had already sworn unto Allah that they would not turn their backs (to the foe). An oath to Allah must be answered for. ^qPickthall3315


Yet they had made covenant with God before that, that they would not turn their backs; and covenants with God shall be questioned of ^qArberry3315

# 16

Qul lany y anfa'akumul firaaru in farartum minal mawti awil qatli wa izal laa tumatta'oona illaa qaleelaa ^qTrans3316


Say: “Whether you flee from [natural] death or from being slain [in battle], flight will not profit you - for, however you fare, you are not [allowed] to enjoy life for more than a little while!” ^qAsad3316


Say: Flight will not avail you if ye flee from death or killing, and then ye dwell in comfort but a little while. ^qPickthall3316


Say: 'Flight will not profit you, if you flee from death or slaying; you will be given enjoyment of days then but little.' ^qArberry3316

Qul m an zal lazee ya'simukum minal laahi in araada bikum sooo'an aw araada bikum rahmah; wa laa yajidoona lahum min doonil laahi waliyyanw wa laa naseeraa ^qTrans3317


Say: “Who is there that could keep you away from God if it be His will to harm you, or if it be His will to show you mercy?” For, [do they not know that] besides God they can find none to protect them, and none to bring them succour? ^qAsad3317


Say: Who is he who can preserve you from Allah if He intendeth harm for you, or intendeth mercy for you. They will not find that they have any friend or helper other than Allah. ^qPickthall3317


Say: 'Who is he that shall defend you from God, if lie desires evil for you, or desires mercy for you?' They shall find for themselves, apart from God, neither protector nor helper. ^qArberry3317

Qad ya'lamul laahul mu'awwiqeena minkum walqaaa'ileena li ikhwaanihim hahumma ilainaa, wa laa yaatoonal baasa illaa qaleelaa ^qTrans3318


God is indeed aware of those of you who would divert others [from fighting in His cause], as well as of those who say to their brethren, “Come hither to us [and face the enemy]!” — The while they [themselves] join battle but seldom, ^qAsad3318


Allah already knoweth those of you who hinder, and those who say unto their brethren: "Come ye hither unto us!" and they come not to the stress of battle save a little, ^qPickthall3318


God would surely know those of you who hinder, and those who say to their brothers, 'Come to us,' and come to battle but little, ^qArberry3318

begrudging you all help. But then, when danger threatens, thou canst see them looking to thee [for help, O Prophet], their eyes rolling [in terror] like [the eyes of] one who is overshadowed by death: yet as soon as the danger has passed, they will assail you [believers] with sharp tongues, begrudging you all that is good! [People like] these have never known faith - and therefore God will cause all their works to come to nought: for this is indeed easy for God. ^qAsad3319


Being sparing of their help to you (believers). But when the fear cometh, then thou (Muhammad) seest them regarding thee with rolling eyes like one who fainteth unto death. Then, when the fear departeth, they scald you with sharp tongues in their greed for wealth (from the spoil). Such have not believed. Therefor Allah maketh their deeds fruitless. And that is easy for Allah. ^qPickthall3319


being niggardly towards you. When fear comes upon them, thou seest them looking at thee, their eyes rolling like one who swoons of death; but when the fear departs, they flay you with sharp tongues, being niggardly to possess the good things. Those have never believed; God has made their works to fail; and that is easy for God. ^qArberry3319

They think that the Confederates have not [really] withdrawn; and should the Confederates return, these [hypocrites] would prefer to be in the desert, among the bedouin, asking for news about you, [O believers, from far away;] and even were they to find themselves in your midst, they would but make a pretence at fighting [by your side]. ^qAsad3320


They hold that the clans have not retired (for good); and if the clans should advance (again), they would fain be in the desert with the wandering Arabs, asking for the news of you; and if they were among you, they would not give battle, save a little. ^qPickthall3320


They think the Confederates have not departed; and if the Confederates come, they will wish that they were desert-dwellers among the Bedoums asking for news of you. If they were among you, they would fight but little. ^qArberry3320

Laqad kaana lakum fee Rasoolil laahi uswatun hasanatul liman kaana yarjul laaha wal yawmal Aakhira wa azkaral laaha kaseeraa ^qTrans3321


VERILY, in the Apostle of God you have a good example for everyone who looks forward [with hope and awe] to God and the Last Day, and remembers God unceasingly. ^qAsad3321


Verily in the messenger of Allah ye have a good example for him who looketh unto Allah and the Last Day, and remembereth Allah much. ^qPickthall3321


You have had a good example in God's Messenger for whosoever hopes for God and the Last Day, and remembers God oft. ^qArberry3321

Wa lammaa ra al mu'minoonal Ahzaaba qaaloo haaza maa wa'adanal laahu wa Rasooluh; wa maa zaadahum illaaa eemaananw wa tasleemaa ^qTrans3322


And [so,] when the believers saw the Con­federates [advancing against them], they said, “This is what God and His Apostle have promised us!”- and, “Truly spoke God and His Apostle!” and all this but increased their faith and their readiness to surrender themselves unto God. ^qAsad3322


And when the true believers saw the clans, they said: This is that which Allah and His messenger promised us. Allah and His messenger are true. It did but confirm them in their faith and resignation. ^qPickthall3322


When the believers saw the Confederates they said, 'This is what God and His Messenger promised us, and God and His Messenger have spoken truly.' And it only increased them in faith and surrender. ^qArberry3322

Minal mu'mineena rijaalun sadaqoo maa 'aahadul laaha 'alaihi faminhum man qadaa nahbahoo wa minhum mai yantaziru wa maa baddaloo tabdeelaa ^qTrans3323


Among the believers are men who have [always] been true to what they have vowed before God; and among them are such as have [already] redeemed their pledge by death, and such as yet await [its fulfillment] without having changed [their resolve] in the least. ^qAsad3323


Of the believers are men who are true to that which they covenanted with Allah. Some of them have paid their vow by death (in battle), and some of them still are waiting; and they have not altered in the least; ^qPickthall3323


Among the believers are men who were true to their covenant with God; some of them have fulfilled their vow by death, and some are still awaiting, and they have not changed in the least; ^qArberry3323

Li yajziyal aahus saadiqeena bisidqihim wa yu'azzibal munaafiqeena in shaaa'a aw yatooba 'alaihim; innal laaha kaana Ghafoorar Raheemaa ^qTrans3324


[Such trials are imposed upon man] so that God may reward the truthful for having been true to their word, and cause the hypocrites to suffer - if that be His will - or [if they repent,] accept their repen­tance: for, verily, God is indeed much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace! ^qAsad3324


That Allah may reward the true men for their truth, and punish the hypocrites if He will, or relent toward them (if He will). Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. ^qPickthall3324


that God may recompense the truthful ones for their truthfulness, and chastise the hypocrites, if He will, or turn again unto them. Surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate. ^qArberry3324

Wa raddal laahul lazeena kafaroo bighaizihim lam yanaaloo khairaa; wa kafal laahul mu'mineenal qitaal; wa kaanal laahu Qawiyyan 'Azeezaa ^qTrans3325


Thus, for all their fury, God repulsed those who were bent on denying the truth; no advantage did they gain, since God was enough to [protect] the believers in battle - seeing that God is most powerful, almighty; ^qAsad3325


And Allah repulsed the disbelievers in their wrath; they gained no good. Allah averted their attack from the believers. Allah is ever Strong, Mighty. ^qPickthall3325


And God sent back those that were unbelievers in their rage, and they attained no good; God spared the believers of fighting. Surely God is All-strong, All-mighty. ^qArberry3325

and He brought down from their strongholds those of the followers of earlier reve­lation who had aided the aggressors, and cast terror into their hearts: some you slew, and some you made captive; ^qAsad3326


And He brought those of the People of the Scripture who supported them down from their strongholds, and cast panic into their hearts. Some ye slew, and ye made captive some. ^qPickthall3326


And He brought down those of the People of the Book who supported them from their fortresses and cast terror in their hearts; some you slew, some you made captive. ^qArberry3326

Wa awrasakum ardahum wa diyaarahum wa amwaalahum wa ardal lam tata'oohaa; wa kaanal laahu 'alaa kulli shai'in Qadeeraa ^qTrans3327


and He made you heirs to their lands, and their houses, and their goods - and [promised you] lands on which you had never yet set foot: for God has indeed the power to will anything. ^qAsad3327


And He caused you to inherit their land and their houses and their wealth, and land ye have not trodden. Allah is ever Able to do all things. ^qPickthall3327


And He bequeathed upon you their lands, their habitations, and their possessions, and a land you never trod. God is powerful over everything. ^qArberry3327

O PROPHET! Say unto thy wives: “If you desire [but] the life of this world and its charms - well, then, I shall provide for you and release you in a becoming manner; ^qAsad3328


O Prophet! Say unto thy wives: If ye desire the world's life and its adornment, come! I will content you and will release you with a fair release. ^qPickthall3328


O Prophet, say to thy wives: 'If you desire the present life and its adornment, come now, I will make you provision, and set you free with kindliness. ^qArberry3328

but if you desire God and His Apostle, and [thus the good of] the life in the hereafter, then [know that], verily, for the doers of good among you God has readied a mighty reward!” ^qAsad3329


But if ye desire Allah and His messenger and the abode of the Hereafter, then lo! Allah hath prepared for the good among you an immense reward. ^qPickthall3329


But if you desire God and His Messenger and the Last Abode, surely God has prepared for those amongst you such as do good a mighty wage. ^qArberry3329

Yaa nisaaa'an Nabiyyi mai yaati minkunna bifaa hishatim mubaiyinatiny yudaa'af lahal 'azaabu di'fain wa kaana zaalika 'alal laahi yaseera ^qTrans3330


O wives of the Prophet! If any of you were to become guilty of manifestly immoral conduct, double [that of other sinners] would be her suffering [in the hereafter]: for that is indeed easy for God. ^qAsad3330


O ye wives of the Prophet! Whosoever of you committeth manifest lewdness, the punishment for her will be doubled, and that is easy for Allah. ^qPickthall3330


Wives of the Prophet, whosoever among you commits a flagrant indecency, for her the chastisement shall be doubled; that is easy for God. ^qArberry3330

Wa mai yaqnut minkunna lillaahi wa Rasoolihee wa ta'mal saalihan nu'tihaaa ajrahaa marratayni wa a'tadnaa lahaa rizqan kareema ^qTrans3331


But if any of you devoutly obeys God and His Apostle and does good deeds, on her shall We bestow her reward twice-over: for We shall have readied for her a most excellent sustenance [in the life to come]. ^qAsad3331


And whosoever of you is submissive unto Allah and His messenger and doeth right, We shall give her her reward twice over, and We have prepared for her a rich provision. ^qPickthall3331


But whosoever of you is obedient to God and His Messenger, and does righteousness, We shall pay her her wage twice over; We have prepared for her a generous provision. ^qArberry3331

O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any of the [other] women, provided that you remain [truly] conscious of God. Hence, be not over-soft in your speech, lest any whose heart is diseased should be moved to desire [you]: but, withal, speak in a kindly way. ^qAsad3332


O ye wives of the Prophet! Ye are not like any other women. If ye keep your duty (to Allah), then be not soft of speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease aspire (to you), but utter customary speech. ^qPickthall3332

And abide quietly in your homes, and do not flaunt your charms as they used to flaunt them in the old days of pagan ignorance; and be constant in prayer, and render the purifying dues, and pay heed unto God and His Apostle: for God only wants to remove from you all that might be loathsome, O you members of the [Prophet’s] household, and to purify you to utmost purity. ^qAsad3333


And stay in your houses. Bedizen not yourselves with the bedizenment of the Time of Ignorance. Be regular in prayer, and pay the poor-due, and obey Allah and His messenger.

[But] then, when Zayd had come to the end of his union with her, We gave her to thee in marriage, so that [in future] no blame should attach to the be­lievers for [marrying] the spouses of their adopted children when the latter have come to the end of their union with them.

So when Zeyd had performed that necessary formality (of divorce) from her, We gave her unto thee in marriage, so that (henceforth) there may be no sin for believers in respect of wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have performed the necessary formality (of release) from them. The commandment of Allah must be fulfilled. ^qPickthall3337

And [as for the Prophet’s wives,] whenever you ask them for anything that you need, ask them from behind a screen: this will but deepen the purity of your hearts and theirs.

THUS IT IS: if the hypocrites, and they in whose hearts is disease, and they who, by spreading false rumours, would cause disturbances in the City [of the Prophet] desist not [from their hostile doings].

[And so it is] that God imposes suffering on the hypocrites, both men and women, as well as on the men and women who ascribe divinity to aught beside Him.

So Allah punisheth hypocritical men and hypocritical women, and idolatrous men and idolatrous women. But Allah pardoneth believing men and believing women, and Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. ^qPickthall3373


That God may chastise the hypocrites, men and women alike, and the idolaters, men and women alike; and that God may turn again unto the believers, men and women alike. God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate. ^qArberry3373
