Inna Fir'awna 'alaa fil ardi wa ja'ala ahlahaa shiya'ai yastad'ifu taaa'ifatam minhum yuzabbihu abnaaa'ahum wa yastahyee nisaaa'ahum; innahoo kaana minal mufsideen ^qTrans284


Behold, Pharaoh exalted himself in the land and divided its people into castes. One group of them he deemed utterly low; he would slaughter their sons and spare (only) their women: for, behold, he was one of those who spread corruption [on earth]. ^qAsad284


Lo! Pharaoh exalted himself in the earth and made its people castes. A tribe among them he oppressed, killing their sons and sparing their women. Lo! he was of those who work corruption. ^qPickthall284


Now Pharaoh had exalted himself in the land and had divided its inhabitants into sects, abasing one party of them, slaughtering their sons, and sparing their women; for he was of the workers of corruption. ^qArberry284

Wa nureedu an namunna 'alal lazeenas tud'ifoo fil ardi wa naj'alahum a'immatanw wa naj'alahumul waariseen ^qTrans285


But it was Our will to bestow Our favour upon those [very people] who were deemed [so] utterly low in the land, and to make them forerunners in faith. and to make them heirs [to Pharaoh’s glory], ^qAsad285


And We desired to show favour unto those who were oppressed in the earth, and to make them examples and to make them the inheritors, ^qPickthall285


Yet We desired to be gracious to those that were abased in the land, and to make them leaders, and to make them the inheritors, ^qArberry285

Wa numakkina lahum fil ardi wa nuriya Fir'awna wa Haamaana wa junoodahumaa minhum maa kaanoo yahzaroon ^qTrans286


and to establish them securely on earth, and to let Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts experience through those [children of Israel] the very thing against which they sought to protect themselves. ^qAsad286


And to establish them in the earth, and to show Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts that which they feared from them. ^qPickthall286


and to establish them in the land, and to show Pharaoh and Ha man, and their hosts, what they were dreading from them. ^qArberry286

And so, [when he was born,] We inspired [thus] the mother of Moses: Suckle him [for a time], and then, when thou hast cause to fear for him, cast him into the river, and have no fear and do not grieve - for We shall restore him to thee, and shall make him one of Our message-bearers!” ^qAsad287


And We inspired the mother of Moses, saying: Suckle him and, when thou fearest for him, then cast him into the river and fear not nor grieve. Lo! We shall bring him back unto thee and shall make him (one) of Our messengers. ^qPickthall287


So We revealed to Moses' mother, 'Suckle him, then, when thou fearest for him, cast him into the sea, and do not fear, neither sorrow, for We shall return him to thee, and shall appoint him one of the Envoys.' ^qArberry287

Faltaqatahooo Aalu Fir'awna li yakoona lahum 'aduwwanw wa hazanaa; inna Fir'awna wa Haamaana wa junooda humaa kaanoo khaati'een ^qTrans288


And [some of] Pharaoh’s household found [and spared] him: for [We had willed] that he becomes an enemy unto them and [a source of] grief, seeing that Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were sinners indeed! ^qAsad288


And the family of Pharaoh took him up, that he might become for them an enemy and a sorrow, Lo! Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were ever sinning. ^qPickthall288


So then the folk of Pharaoh picked him out to be an enemy and a sorrow to them; certainly Pharaoh and Haman, and their hosts, were of the sinners. ^qArberry288

Wa qaalatim ra atu Fir'awna qurratu 'aynil lee wa lak; laa taqtuloohu 'asaaa aiyanfa'anaa aw nattakhizahoo waladanw wa hum laa yash'uroon ^qTrans289


Now the wife of Pharaoh said: “A joy to the eye [could this child be] for me and thee! Slay him not: he may well be of use to us, or we may adopt him as a son!” And they had no presentiment [of what he was to become]. ^qAsad289


And the wife of Pharaoh said: (He will be) a consolation for me and for thee. Kill him not. Peradventure he may be of use to us, or we may choose him for a son. And they perceived not. ^qPickthall289


Said Pharaoh's wife, 'He will be a comfort to me and thee. Slay him not; perchance he will profit us, or we will take him for a son.' And they were not aware. ^qArberry289

Wa asbaha fu'aadu ummi Moosaa faarighan in kaadat latubdee bihee law laaa arrabatnaa 'alaa qalbihaa litakoona minal mu'mineen ^qTrans2810


On the morrow, however, an aching void grew up in the heart of the mother of Moses, and she would indeed have disclosed all about him had We not endowed her heart with enough strength to keep alive her faith [in Our promise]. ^qAsad2810


And the heart of the mother of Moses became void, and she would have betrayed him if We had not fortified her heart, that she might be of the believers. ^qPickthall2810


On the morrow the heart of Moses" mother became empty, and she wellnigh disclosed him had We not strengthened her heart, that she might be among the believers; ^qArberry2810

# 11

Wa qaalat li ukhtihee qusseehi fabasurat bihee 'an junubinw wahum laa yash'uroon ^qTrans2811


And so she said to his sister, “Follow him” - and [the girl] watched him from afar, while they [who had taken him in] were not aware of it, ^qAsad2811


And she said unto his sister: Trace him. So she observed him from afar, and they perceived not. ^qPickthall2811


and she said to his sister, 'Follow him,' and she perceived him from afar, even while they were not aware. ^qArberry2811

# 12

Wa harramnaa 'alaihil maraadi'a min qablu faqaalat hal adullukum 'alaaa ahli baitiny yakfuloonahoo lakum wa hum lahoo naasihoon ^qTrans2812


Now from the very beginning We caused him to refuse the breast of [Egyptian] nurses; and [when his sister came to know this,] she said: “Shall I guide you to a family that might rear him for you, and look after him with good will?” ^qAsad2812


And We had before forbidden foster-mothers for him, so she said: Shall I show you a household who will rear him for you and take care of him? ^qPickthall2812


Now We had forbidden to him aforetime to be suckled by any foster-mother; therefore she said, 'Shall I direct you to the people of a household who will take charge of him for you and look after him?' ^qArberry2812

Faradadnaahu ilaa ummihee kai taqarra 'ainuhaa wa laa tahzana wa lita'lama anna wa'dal laahi haqqunw wa laakinna aksarahum laa ya'lamoon ^qTrans2813


And thus We restored him to his mother, so that her eye might he gladdened, and that she might grieve no longer, and that she might know that God’s promise always comes true - even though most of them know it not! ^qAsad2813


So We restored him to his mother that she might be comforted and not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true. But most of them know not. ^qPickthall2813


So We returned him to his mother, that she might be comforted and not sorrow, and that she might know that the promise of God is true; but most of them do not know. ^qArberry2813

# 14

Wa lammaa balagha ashuddahoo wastawaaa aatai naahu hukmanw wa 'ilmaa; wa kazaalika najzil muhsineen ^qTrans2814


Now when [Moses] reached full manhood and had become mature [of mind]. We bestowed upon him the ability to judge [between right and wrong] as well as [innate] knowledge: for thus do We reward the doers of good. ^qAsad2814


And when he reached his full strength and was ripe, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus do We reward the good. ^qPickthall2814


And when he was fully grown and in the perfection of his strength, We gave him judgment and knowledge; even so do We recompense the good-doers. ^qArberry2814

And [one day] he entered the city at a time when [most of] its people were [resting in their houses,] unaware of what was going on [in the streets]; and there he encountered two men fighting with one another - one of his own people, and the other of his enemies. And the one who belonged to his own people cried out to him for help against him who was of his enemies - whereupon Moses struck him down with his fist, and [thus] brought about his end. [But then] he said [to himself]: “This is of Satan’s doing! Verily, he is an open foe, leading [man] astray!” ^qAsad2815


And he entered the city at a time of carelessness of its folk, and he found therein two men fighting, one of his own caste, and the other of his enemies; and he who was of his caste asked him for help against him who was of his enemies. So Moses struck him with his fist and killed him. He said: This is of the devil's doing. Lo! he is an enemy, a mere misleader. ^qPickthall2815


And he entered the city, at a time when its people were unheeding, and found there two men fighting; the one was of his own party, and the other was of his enemies. Then the one that was of his party cried to him to aid him against the other that was of his enemies; so Moses struck him, and despatched him, and said, 'This is of Satan's doing; he is surely an enemy misleading, manifest.' ^qArberry2815

# 16

Qaala Rabbi innee zalamtu nafsee faghfir lee faghafaralah; innahoo Huwal Ghafoorur Raheem ^qTrans2816


[And] he prayed: O my Sustainer! Verily, I have sinned against myself! Grant me, then, Thy forgiveness!” And He forgave him - for, verily, He alone is truly forgiving, a dispenser of grace. ^qAsad2816


He said: My Lord! Lo! I have wronged my soul, so forgive me. Then He forgave him. Lo! He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. ^qPickthall2816


He said, 'My Lord, I have wronged myself. Forgive me!' So God forgave him, for He is the All-forgiving, the All-compassionate. ^qArberry2816

# 17

Qaala Rabbi bimaaa an'amta 'alaiya falan akoona zaheeral lilmujrimeen ^qTrans2817


Said he: “O my Sustainer! [I vow] by all the blessings which Thou hast bestowed on me: Never­more shall I aid such as are lost in sin!” ^qAsad2817


He said: My Lord! Forasmuch as Thou hast favoured me, I will nevermore be a supporter of the guilty. ^qPickthall2817


He said, 'My Lord, forasmuch as Thou hast blessed me, I will never be a partisan of the sinners.' ^qArberry2817

Fa asbaha fil madeenati khaaa'ifany yataraqqabu fa izal lazis tansarahoo bil amsi yastasrikhuh; qaala lahoo moosaaa innaka laghawiyyum mubeen ^qTrans2818


And next morning he found himself in the city, looking fearfully about him, when lo! the one who had sought his help the day before [once again] cried out to him [for help whereupon] Moses said unto him: “Behold, thou art indeed, most clearly, deeply in the wrong! ^qAsad2818


And morning found him in the city, fearing, vigilant, when behold! he who had appealed to him the day before cried out to him for help. Moses said unto him: Lo! thou art indeed a mere hothead. ^qPickthall2818


Now in the morning he was in the city, fearful and vigilant; and behold, the man who had sought his, succour on the day before cried out to him again. Moses said to him, 'Clearly thou art, a quarreller.' ^qArberry2818

But then as soon as he was about to lay violent hands on the man who was their [common] enemy, the latter exclaimed: “O Moses, dost thou intend to slay me as thou didst slay another man yesterday? Thy sole aim is to become a tyrant in this land, for thou dost not care to be of those who would set things to rights!” ^qAsad2819


And when he would have fallen upon the man who was an enemy unto them both, he said: O Moses! Wouldst thou kill me as thou didst kill a person yesterday. Thou wouldst be nothing but a tyrant in the land, thou wouldst not be of the reformers. ^qPickthall2819


But when he would have assaulted the man who was an enemy to them both, the man said, 'Moses, dost thou' desire to slay me, even as thou slewest a living 'soul yesterday? Thou only desirest to be a tyrant in the land; thou desirest not to be of them that put things right.' ^qArberry2819

Wa jaaa'a rajulum min aqsal madeenati yas'aa qaala yaa Moosaaa innal mala a yaa tamiroona bika liyaqtulooka fakhruj innee laka minan naasiheen ^qTrans2820


And [then and there] a man came running from the farthermost end of the city, and said: “O Moses! Behold, the great ones [of the kingdom] are deli­berating upon thy case with a view to killing thee! Begone, then: verily, I am of those who wish thee well!” ^qAsad2820


And a man came from the uttermost part of the city, running. He said: O Moses! Lo! the chiefs take counsel against thee to slay thee; therefor escape. Lo! I am of those who give thee good advice. ^qPickthall2820


Then came a man from the furthest part of the city, running; he said, 'Moses, the Council are conspiring to slay thee. Depart; I am one of thy sincere advisers.' ^qArberry2820

# 21

Fakharaja minhaa khaaa 'ifany-yataraqqab; qaala Rabbi najjinee minal qawmiz zaalimeen ^qTrans2821


So he went forth from thence, looking fearfully about him, and prayed: “O my Sustainer! Save me from all evildoing folk!” ^qAsad2821


So he escaped from thence, fearing, vigilant. He said: My Lord! Deliver me from the wrongdoing folk. ^qPickthall2821


So he departed therefrom, fearful and vigilant; he said, 'My Lord, deliver me from the people of the evildoers.' ^qArberry2821

# 22

Wa lammaa tawajjaha tilqaaa'a Madyana qaala 'asaa Rabbeee ai yahdiyanee Sawaaa'as Sabeel ^qTrans2822


And as he turned his face towards Madyan, he said [to himself]: “It may well be that my Sustainer will [thus] guide me onto the right path” ^qAsad2822


And when he turned his face toward Midian, he said: Peradventure my Lord will guide me in the right road. ^qPickthall2822


And when he turned his face towards Midian he said, 'It may be that my Lord will guide me ^qArberry2822

# 23

Wa lammaa warada maaa'a Madyana wajada 'alaihi ummatam minannaasi yasqoona wa wajada min doonihimum ra ataini tazoodaani qaala maa khatubkumaa qaalataa laa nasqee hataa yusdirar ri'aaa'u wa aboonaa shaikhun kabeer ^qTrans2823


NOW WHEN he arrived at the wells of Madyan, he found there a large group of men who were watering [their herds and flocks]; and at some distance from them he came upon two women who were keeping back their flock. He asked [them]: “What is the matter with you?” They answered: “We cannot water [our animals] until the herdsmen drive [theirs] home - for [we are weak and] our father is a very old man.” ^qAsad2823


And when he came unto the water of Midian he found there a whole tribe of men, watering. And he found apart from them two women keeping back (their flocks). He said: What aileth you? The two said: We cannot give (our flocks) to drink till the shepherds return from the water; and our father is a very old man. ^qPickthall2823


On the right way. And when he came to the waters of Midian he found a company of the people there drawing water, and he found, apart from them, two women holding back their flocks. He said, 'What is your business?' They said, 'We may not draw water until the shepherds drive off; and our father is passing old.' ^qArberry2823

# 24

Fasaqaa lahumaa summa tawallaaa ilaz zilli faqaala Rabbi innee limaaa anzalta ilaiya min khairin faqeer ^qTrans2824


So he watered [their flock] for them: and when he withdrew into the shade and prayed: “O my Sus­tainer! Verily, in dire need am I of any good which Thou mayest bestow upon me!” ^qAsad2824


So he watered (their flock) for them. Then he turned aside into the shade, and said: My Lord! I am needy of whatever good Thou sendest down for me. ^qPickthall2824


So he drew water for them; then he turned away to the shade, and he said, 'O my Lord, surely I have need of whatever good Thou shalt have sent down upon me. ^qArberry2824

[Shortly] afterwards, one of the two [maidens] approached him, walking shyly, and said: “Behold, my father invites thee, so that he might duly reward thee for thy having watered [our flock] for us.” And as soon as [Moses] came unto him and told him the story [of his life], he said: “Have no fear! Thou art now safe from those evildoing folk!” ^qAsad2825


Then there came unto him one of the two women, walking shyly. She said: Lo! my father biddeth thee, that he may reward thee with a payment for that thou didst water (the flock) for us. Then, when he came unto him and told him the (whole) story, he said: Fear not! Thou hast escaped from the wrongdoing folk. ^qPickthall2825


Then came one of the two women to him, walking modestly, and said, 'My father invites thee, that he may recompense thee with the wage of thy drawing water for us.' So when he came to him and had related to him the story, he said, 'Be not afraid; thou hast escaped from the people of the evildoers.' ^qArberry2825

Said one of the two [daughters]: “O my father! Hire him: for, behold, the best [man] that thou couldst hire is one who is [as] strong and worthy of trust [as he]!” ^qAsad2826


One of the two women said: O my father! Hire him! For the best (man) that thou canst hire in the strong, the trustworthy. ^qPickthall2826


Said one of the two women, 'Father, hire him; surely the best man thou canst hire is the one strong and trusty.' ^qArberry2826

[After some time, the father] said: “Behold, I am willing to let thee wed one of these two daughters of mine on the understanding that thou wilt remain eight years in my service; and if thou shouldst com­plete ten [years], that would be [an act of grace] from thee, for I do not want to impose any hardship on thee: [on the contrary,] thou wilt find me, if God so wills, righteous in all my dealings.” ^qAsad2827


He said: Lo! I fain would marry thee to one of these two daughters of mine on condition that thou hirest thyself to me for (the term of) eight pilgrimages. Then if thou completest ten it will be of thine own accord, for I would not make it hard for thee. Allah willing, thou wilt find me of the righteous. ^qPickthall2827


He said, 'I desire to marry thee to one of these my two daughters, on condition that thou hirest thyself to me for eight years. If thou completest ten, that shall be of thy own accord; I do not desire to' press hard 'upon thee. Thou shalt assuredly find me, if God wills, one of the righteous.' ^qArberry2827

Qaala zaalika bainee wa bainaka aiyamal ajalaini qadaitu falaa 'udwaana 'alaiya wallaahu 'alaa ma naqoolu Wakeel ^qTrans2828


Answered [Moses]: “Thus shall it be between me and thee! Whichever of the two terms I fulfill, let there be no ill will against me. And God be witness to all that we say!” ^qAsad2828


He said: That (is settled) between thee and me. Whichever of the two terms I fulfil, there will be no injustice to me, and Allah is Surety over what we say. ^qPickthall2828


Said he, 'So let it be between me and thee. Whichever of the two' terms I fulfil, it shall be no Injustice to me; and God is guardian of what we say. ^qArberry2828

And when Moses had fulfilled his term and was wandering with his family [in the desert], he per­ceived a fire on the slope of Mount Sinai; [and so] he said to his family: “Wait here. Behold, I perceive a fire [far away]; perhaps I may bring you from there some tiding, or [at least] a burning brand from the fire, so that you might warm yourselves. ^qAsad2829


Then, when Moses had fulfilled the term, and was travelling with his housefolk, he saw in the distance a fire and said unto his housefolk: Bide ye (here). Lo! I see in the distance a fire; peradventure I shall bring you tidings thence, or a brand from the fire that ye may warm yourselves. ^qPickthall2829


So when Moses had accomplished the term and departed with his household, he observed on the side of the Mount a fire. He said to his household, 'Tarry you here; I observe a fire. Perhaps I shall bring you news of it, or a faggot from the fire, that haply you shall warm yourselves.' ^qArberry2829

But when he came close to it, a call was sounded from the right-side bank of the valley, out of the tree [burning] on blessed ground: “O Moses! Verily, I am God, the Sustainer of all the worlds!” ^qAsad2830


And when he reached it, he was called from the right side of the valley in the blessed field, from the tree: O Moses! Lo! I, even I, am Allah, the Lord of the Worlds; ^qPickthall2830


When he came to it, a voice cried from the right of the watercourse, in the sacred hollow, coming from the tree: 'Moses, I am God, the Lord of all Being.' ^qArberry2830

And [then He said]: “Throw down thy staff!” But as soon as [Moses] saw it move rapidly, as if it were a snake, he drew back [in terror], and did not [dare to] return. [And God spoke to him again:] “O Moses! Draw near, and have no fear - for, behold, thou art of those who are secure [in this world and in the next]! ^qAsad2831


Throw down thy staff. And when he saw it writhing as it had been a demon, he turned to flee headlong, (and it was said unto him): O Moses! Draw nigh and fear not. Lo! thou art of those who are secure. ^qPickthall2831


'Cast down thy staff.' And when he saw it quivering like a serpent, he turned about retreating, and turned not back. 'Moses, come forward, and fear not; for surely thou art in security.' ^qArberry2831

“[And now] put thy hand into thy bosom: it will come forth [shining] white, without blemish.

[NOW,] BEHOLD, Qarun was one of the people of Moses; but he arrogantly exalted himself above them - simply because We had granted him such riches that his treasure-chests alone would surely have been too heavy a burden for a troop of ten men or even more.
