Wal Kitaabil Mubeen ^qTrans432


CONSIDER this divine writ, clear in itself and clearly showing the truth: ^qAsad432


By the Scripture which maketh plain, ^qPickthall432


By the Clear Book, ^qArberry432

# 3

Innaa ja'alnaahu Quraanan 'Arabiyyal la'allakum ta'qiloon ^qTrans433


behold, We have caused it to be a discourse in the Arabic tongue, so that you might encompass it with your reason. ^qAsad433


Lo! We have appointed it a Lecture, in Arabic that haply ye may understand. ^qPickthall433


behold, We have made it an Arabic Koran; haply you will understand; ^qArberry433

# 4

Wa innahoo feee Ummil Kitaabi Ladainaa la'aliyyun hakeem ^qTrans434


And, verily, [originating as it does] in the source, with Us, of all revelation, it is indeed sublime, full of wisdom. ^qAsad434


And Lo! in the Source of Decrees, which We possess, it is indeed sublime, decisive. ^qPickthall434


and behold, it is in the Essence of the Book, with Us; sublime indeed, wise. ^qArberry434

# 5

Afanadribu 'ankumuz Zikra safhan an kuntum qawmam musrifeen ^qTrans435


[O YOU who deny the truth!] Should We, perchance, withdraw this reminder from you altogether, seeing that you are people bent on wasting your own selves? ^qAsad435


Shall We utterly ignore you because ye are a wanton folk? ^qPickthall435


Shall We turn away the Remembrance from you, for that you are a prodigal people? ^qArberry435

# 6

Wa kam arsalnaa min Nabiyyin fil awwaleen ^qTrans436


And how many a prophet did We send to people of olden times! ^qAsad436


How many a prophet did We send among the men of old! ^qPickthall436


How many a Prophet We sent among the ancients, ^qArberry436

# 7

Wa maa yaateehim min Nabiyyin illaa kaanoo bihee yasahzi'oon ^qTrans437


But never yet came a prophet to them without their deriding him – ^qAsad437


And never came there unto them a prophet but they used to mock him. ^qPickthall437


but not a Prophet came to them, without they mocked at him; ^qArberry437

# 8

Fa ahlaknaaa ashadda minhum batshanw wa madaa masalul lawwaleen ^qTrans438


and so, [in the end,] We destroyed them [even though they were] of greater might than these: and the [very] image of those people of old became a thing of the past. ^qAsad438


Then We destroyed men mightier than these in prowess; and the example of the men of old hath gone (before them). ^qPickthall438


so We destroyed men stronger in valour than they, and the example of the ancients passed away. ^qArberry438

# 9

Wa la'in sa altahum man khalaqas samaawaati wal arda la yaqoolunna khalaqa hunnal 'Azeezul 'Aleem ^qTrans439


Yet thus it is [with most people]: if thou ask them, “Who is it that has created the heavens and the earth?” - they will surely answer, “The Almighty, the All-Knowing has created them.” ^qAsad439


And if thou (Muhammad) ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth, they will surely answer: The Mighty, the Knower created them; ^qPickthall439


If thou askest them, 'Who created the heavens and earth?' they will say, 'The All-mighty, the All-knowing created them.' ^qArberry439

# 10

Allazee ja'ala lakumul arda mahdanw wa ja'ala lakum feehaa subulal la'allakum tahtadoon ^qTrans4310


He it is who has made the earth a cradle for you, and has provided for you ways [of livelihood] thereon, so that you might follow the right path. ^qAsad4310


Who made the earth a resting-place for you, and placed roads for you therein, that haply ye may find your way; ^qPickthall4310


He who appointed the earth to be a cradle for you, and appointed ways for you therein, that haply you may be guided; ^qArberry4310

# 11

Wallazee nazzala minas samaaa'i maaa'am biqadarin fa anshamaa bihee baldatam maitaa' kazaalika tukhrajoon ^qTrans4311


And He it is who sends down, again and again, waters from the sky in due measure: and [as] We raise therewith dead land to life, even thus will you be brought forth [from the dead]. ^qAsad4311


And Who sendeth down water from the sky in (due) measure, and We revive a dead land therewith. Even so will ye be brought forth; ^qPickthall4311


and who sent down out of heaven water in measure; and We revived thereby a land that was dead; even so you shall be brought forth; ^qArberry4311

# 12

Wallazee khalaqal azwaaja kullahaa wa ja'ala lakum minal fulki wal-an'aami maa tarkaboon ^qTrans4312


And He it is who has created all opposites. And He [it is who] has provided for you all those ships and animals whereon you ride, ^qAsad4312


He Who created all the pairs, and appointed for you ships and cattle whereupon ye ride. ^qPickthall4312


and who created the pairs, all of them, and appointed for you ships and cattle such as you ride, ^qArberry4312

Litastawoo 'alaa zuhoorihee summa tazkuroo ni'mata Rabbikum izastawaitum 'alaihi wa taqooloo Subhaanal lazee sakhkhara lana haaza wa maa kunnaa lahoo muqrineen ^qTrans4313


in order that you might gain mastery over them, and that, whenever you have mastered them, you might remember your Sustainer’s blessings and say: “Limitless in His glory is He who has made [all] this subservient to our use - since [but for Him,] we would not have been able to attain to it. ^qAsad4313


That ye may mount upon their backs, and may remember your Lord's favour when ye mount thereon, and may say: Glorified be He Who hath subdued these unto us, and we were not capable (of subduing them); ^qPickthall4313


that you may be seated on their backs and then remember your Lord's blessing when you are seated on them, and say, 'Glory be to Him, who has subjected this to us, and we ourselves were not equal to it; ^qArberry4313

# 14

Wa innaaa ilaa Rabbinaa lamunqaliboon ^qTrans4314


Hence, verily, it is unto Him that we must always turn.” ^qAsad4314


And lo! unto our Lord we surely are returning. ^qPickthall4314


surely unto our Lord we are turning.' ^qArberry4314

# 15

Wa ja'aloo lahoo min 'ibaadihee juz'aa; innal insaana lakafoorum mubeen ^qTrans4315


AND YET, they attribute to Him offspring from among some of the beings created by Him! Verily, most obviously bereft of all gratitude is man! ^qAsad4315


And they allot to Him a portion of His bondmen! Lo! man is verily a mere ingrate. ^qPickthall4315


Yet they have assigned to Him a part of His own servants! Man is dearly unthankful. ^qArberry4315

# 16

Amit takhaza mimmaa yakhluqu banaatinw wa asfaakum bilbaneen ^qTrans4316


Or [do you think], perchance, that out of all His creation He has chosen for Himself daughters, and favoured you with sons? ^qAsad4316


Or chooseth He daughters of all that He hath created, and honoureth He you with sons? ^qPickthall4316


Or has He taken to Himself, from that He creates, daughters, and favoured you with sons? ^qArberry4316

# 17

Wa izaa bushshira ahaduhum bimaa daraba lir Rahmaani masalan zalla wajhuhoo muswaddanw wa hua kazeem ^qTrans4317


For [thus it is:] if any of them is given the glad tiding of [the birth of] what he so readily attributes to the Most Gracious, his face darkens, and he is filled with suppressed anger: ^qAsad4317


And if one of them hath tidings of that which he likeneth to the Beneficent One, his countenance becometh black and he is full of inward rage. ^qPickthall4317


And when any of them is given the good tidings of that he has likened to the All-merciful, his face is darkened, and he chokes inwardly. ^qArberry4317

# 18

Awa mai yunashsha'u fil hilyati wa huwa fil khisaami ghairu mubeen ^qTrans4318


“What! [Am I to have a daughter -] one who is to be reared [only] for the sake of ornament?” and thereupon he finds himself torn by a vague inner conflict. ^qAsad4318


(Liken they then to Allah) that which is bred up in outward show, and in dispute cannot make itself plain? ^qPickthall4318


What, one who is reared amid ornaments and, when the time of altercation comes, is not to be seen? ^qArberry4318

# 19

Wa ja'alul malaaa'ikatal lazeena hum 'ibaadur Rahmaani inaasaa; a shahidoo khalaqhum; satuktabu shahaa datuhum wa yus'aloon ^qTrans4319


And [yet] they claim that the angels - who in themselves are but beings created by the Most Gracious - are females: [but] did they witness their creation? This false claim of theirs will be recorded, and they will be called to account [for it on Judgment Day]! ^qAsad4319


And they make the angels, who are the slaves of the Beneficent, females. Did they witness their creation? Their testimony will be recorded and they will be questioned. ^qPickthall4319


And they have made the angels, who are themselves servants of the All-merciful, females. What, did they witness their creation? Their witness shall be written down, and they shall be questioned. ^qArberry4319

# 20

Wa qaaloo law shaaa'ar Rahmaanu maa 'abadnaahum; maa lahum bizaalika min 'ilmin in hum illaa yakhrusoon ^qTrans4320


Yet they say, “Had [not] the Most Gracious so willed, we would never have worshipped them!” [But] they cannot have any knowledge of [His having willed] such a thing: they do nothing but guess. ^qAsad4320


And they say: If the Beneficent One had (so) willed, we should not have worshipped them. They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do but guess. ^qPickthall4320


They say, 'Had the All-merciful so willed, we would not have served them.' They have no knowledge of that; they are only conjecturing. ^qArberry4320

# 21

Am aatainaahum Kitaabam min qablihee fahum bihee mustamsikoon ^qTrans4321


Or have We, perchance, vouchsafed them, before this one, a revelation [to the contrary,] to which they are still holding fast? ^qAsad4321


Or have We given them any scripture before (this Qur'an) so that they are holding fast thereto? ^qPickthall4321


Or did We bring them a Book aforetime to which they hold? ^qArberry4321

# 22

Bal qaalooo innaa wajadnaaa aabaaa'anaa 'alaaa ummatinw wa innaa 'alaaa aasaarihim muhtadoon ^qTrans4322


Nay, but they say, “Behold, We found our forefathers agreed on what to believe - and, verily, it is in their footsteps that we find our guidance!” ^qAsad4322


Nay, for they say only: Lo! we found our fathers following a religion, and we are guided by their footprints. ^qPickthall4322


Nay, but they say, 'We found our fathers upon a community, and we are guided upon their traces.' ^qArberry4322

# 23

Wa kazaalika maaa arsalnaa min qablika fee qaryatim min nazeerin illaa qaala mutrafoohaaa innaa wajadnaaa aabaaa'anaa 'alaaa ummatinw wa innaa 'alaaa aasaarihim muqtadoon ^qTrans4323


And thus it is: whenever We sent, before thy time, a warner to any community, those of its people who had lost themselves entirely in the pursuit of pleasures would always say, “Behold, we found our forefathers agreed on what to believe - and, verily, it is but in their footsteps that we follow!” ^qAsad4323


And even so We sent not a warner before thee (Muhammad) into any township but its luxurious ones said: Lo! we found our fathers following a religion, and we are following their footprints. ^qPickthall4323


Even so We sent never before thee any warner into any city, except that its men who lived at ease said, 'We indeed found our fathers upon a community, and we are following upon their traces.' ^qArberry4323

# 24

Qaala awa law ji'tukum bi ahdaa mimmaa wajattum 'alaihi aabaaa'akum qaalooo innaa bimaaa ursiltum bihee kaafiroon ^qTrans4324


[Whereupon each prophet] would say, “Why, even though I bring you guidance better than that which you found your forefathers believing in?” - [to which] the others would reply, “Behold, we deny that there is any truth in [what you claim to be] your messages!” ^qAsad4324


(And the warner) said: What! Even though I bring you better guidance than that ye found your fathers following? They answered: Lo! in what ye bring we are disbelievers. ^qPickthall4324


Say: 'What, though I should bring you a better guidance than you found your fathers upon?' They say, 'We disbelieve in that you were sent with.' ^qArberry4324

# 25

Fantaqamnaa minhum fanzur kaifa kaana 'aaqibatul mukazzibeen ^qTrans4325


And so We inflicted Our retribution on them: and behold what happened in the end to those who gave the lie to the truth! ^qAsad4325


So We requited them. Then see the nature of the consequence for the rejecters! ^qPickthall4325


So We took vengeance upon them; and behold how was the end of them that cried lies. ^qArberry4325

# 26

Wa iz qaala Ibraaheemu liabeehi wa qawmiheee innane baraaa'um mimmaa ta'budo ^qTrans4326


AND WHEN Abraham spoke to his father and his people, [he had this very truth in mind:] “Verily, far be it from me to worship what you worship! ^qAsad4326


And when Abraham said unto his father and his folk: Lo! I am innocent of what ye worship ^qPickthall4326


And when Abraham said to his father and his people, 'Surely I am quit of that you serve, ^qArberry4326

# 27

Illal lazee fataranee innahoo sa yahdeen ^qTrans4327


None [do I worship] but Him who has brought me into being: and, behold, it is He who will guide me!” ^qAsad4327


Save Him Who did create me, for He will surely guide me. ^qPickthall4327


except Him who originated me; and He will guide me. ^qArberry4327

# 28

Wa ja'alahaa Kalimatam baaqiyatan fee 'aqibihee la'al lahum yarji'oon ^qTrans4328


And he uttered this as a word destined to endure among those who would come after him, so that they might [always] return [to it]. ^qAsad4328


And he made it a word enduring among his seed, that haply they might return. ^qPickthall4328


And he made it a word enduring among his posterity; haply so they would return. ^qArberry4328

# 29

Bal matta'tu haaa'ulaaa'i wa aabaaa'ahum hattaa jaaa'a humul haqqu wa Rasoolum mubeen ^qTrans4329


Now [as for those who did come after him,] I allowed them - as [I had allowed] their forebears - to enjoy their lives freely until the truth should come unto them through an apostle who would make all things clear: ^qAsad4329


Nay, but I let these and their fathers enjoy life (only) till there should come unto them the Truth and a messenger making plain. ^qPickthall4329


Nay, but I gave these and their fathers enjoyment of days, until the truth came unto them, and a manifest Messenger. ^qArberry4329

# 30

Wa lammaa jaaa'ahumul haqqu qaaloo haazaa sihrunw wa innaa bihee kaafiroon ^qTrans4330


but now that the truth has come to them, they say, “All this is mere spellbinding eloquence” - and, behold, we deny that there is any truth in it!” ^qAsad4330


And now that the Truth hath come unto them they say: This is mere magic, and lo! we are disbelievers therein. ^qPickthall4330


And when the truth came to them, they said, 'This is a sorcery, and in it we are unbelievers.' ^qArberry4330

# 31

Wa qaaloo law laa nuzzila haazal Quraanu 'alaa rajulim minal qaryataini 'azeem ^qTrans4331


And they say, too, “Why was not this Qur’an bestowed from on high on some great man of the two cities?” ^qAsad4331


And they say: If only this Qur'an had been revealed to some great man of the two towns? ^qPickthall4331


They say, 'Why was this Koran not sent down upon some man of moment in the two cities?' ^qArberry4331

# 32

Ahum yaqsimoona rahmata Rabbik; Nahnu qasamnaa bainahum ma'eeshatahum fil hayaatid dunyaa wa rafa'naa ba'dahum fawqa ba'din darajaatil liyattakhiza ba'duhum ba'dan sukhriyyaa; wa rahmatu Rabbika khairum mimmaa yajma'oon ^qTrans4332


But is it they who distribute thy Sustainer’s grace? [Nay, as] it is We who distribute their means of livelihood among them in the life of this world, and raise some of them by degrees above others, to the end that they might avail themselves of one another’s help - [so, too, it is We who bestow gifts of the spirit upon whomever We will]: and this thy Sustainer’s grace is better than all [the worldly wealth] that they may amass. ^qAsad4332


Is it they who apportion thy Lord's mercy? We have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of the world, and raised some of them above others in rank that some of them may take labour from others; and the mercy of thy Lord is better than (the wealth) that they amass. ^qPickthall4332


What, is it they who divide the mercy of the Lord? We have divided between them their livelihood in the present life, and raised some of them above others in rank, that some of them may take others in servitude; and the mercy of thy Lord is better than that they amass. ^qArberry4332

# 33

Wa law laaa any yakoonan naasu ummatanw waahidatal laja'alnaa limany yakfuru bir Rahmaani libu yootihim suqufam min fiddatinw wa ma'aarija 'alaihaa yazharoon ^qTrans4333


And were it not that [with the prospect of boundless riches before them] all people would become one [evil] community, We might indeed have provided for those who [now] deny the Most Gracious roofs of silver for their houses, and [silver] stairways whereon to ascend, ^qAsad4333


And were it not that mankind would have become one community, We might well have appointed, for those who disbelieve in the Beneficent, roofs of silver for their houses and stairs (of silver) whereby to mount, ^qPickthall4333


And were it not that mankind would be one nation, We would have appointed for those who disbelieve in the All-merciful roofs of silver to their houses, and stairs whereon to mount, ^qArberry4333

# 34

Wa libu yootihim abwaabanw wa sururan 'alaihaa yattaki'oon ^qTrans4334


and [silver] doors for their houses, and [silver] couches whereon to recline, ^qAsad4334


And for their houses doors (of silver) and couches of silver whereon to recline, ^qPickthall4334


and doors to their houses, and couches whereon to recline, ^qArberry4334

# 35

Wa zukhrufaa; wa in kullu zaalika lammaa mataa'ul hayaatid dunyaa; wal aakhiratu 'inda Rabbika lilmuttaqeen ^qTrans4335


and gold [beyond count]. Yet all this would have been nothing but a [brief] enjoyment of life in this world - whereas [happiness in] the life to come awaits the God-conscious with thy Sustainer. ^qAsad4335


And ornaments of gold. Yet all that would have been but a provision of the life of the world. And the Hereafter with your Lord would have been for those who keep from evil. ^qPickthall4335


and ornaments; surely all this is but the enjoyment of the present life, and the world to come with thy Lord is for the godfearing. ^qArberry4335

# 36

Wa mai ya'shu 'an zikrir Rahmaani nuqaiyid lahoo Shaitaanan fahuwa lahoo qareen ^qTrans4336


But as for anyone who chooses to remain blind to the remembrance of the Most Gracious, to him We assign an [enduring] evil impulse, to become his other self: ^qAsad4336


And he whose sight is dim to the remembrance of the Beneficent, We assign unto him a devil who becometh his comrade; ^qPickthall4336


Whoso blinds himself to the Remembrance of the All-merciful, to him We assign a Satan for comrade; ^qArberry4336

# 37

Wa innahum la yasuddoo nahum 'anis sabeeli wa yahsaboona annahum muhtadoon ^qTrans4337


whereupon, behold, these [evil impulses] bar all such from the path [of truth], making them think that they are guided aright! ^qAsad4337


And lo! they surely turn them from the way of Allah, and yet they deem that they are rightly guided; ^qPickthall4337


and they bar them from the way, and they think they are guided, ^qArberry4337

# 38

Hattaaa izaa jaaa'anaa qaala yaa laita bainee wa bainaka bu'dal mashriqaini fabi'sal qareen ^qTrans4338


But in the end, when he [who has thus sinned] appears before us [on Judgment Day], he will say [to his other self], “Would that between me and thee there had been the distance of east and west!” for, evil indeed [has proved] that other self! ^qAsad4338


Till, when he cometh unto Us, he saith (unto his comrade): Ah, would that between me and thee there were the distance of the two horizons - an evil comrade! ^qPickthall4338


till, when he comes to Us, he says, 'Would there had been between me and thee the distance of the two Easts!' An evil comrade! ^qArberry4338

# 39

Wa lai yanfa'akumul Yawma iz zalamtum annakum fil 'azaabi mushtarikoon ^qTrans4339


On that Day it will not profit you in the least [to know] that, since you have sinned [together], you are now to share your suffering [as well]. ^qAsad4339


And it profiteth you not this day, because ye did wrong, that ye will be sharers in the doom. ^qPickthall4339


It shall not profit you today, since you did evil, that you are partners in the chastisement. ^qArberry4339

# 40

Afa anta tusmi'us summa aw tahdil 'umya wa man kaana fee dalaalim mubeen ^qTrans4340


CANST THOU, perchance, [O Muhammad,] make the deaf hear, or show the right way to the blind or to such as are obviously lost in error? ^qAsad4340


Canst thou (Muhammad) make the deaf to hear, or canst thou guide the blind or him who is in error manifest? ^qPickthall4340


What, shalt thou make the deaf to hear, or shalt thou guide the blind and him who is in manifest error? ^qArberry4340

# 41

Fa immaa nazhabanna bika fa innaa minhum muntaqimoon ^qTrans4341


But whether We do [or do not] take thee away [ere thy message prevails] - verily, We shall inflict Our retribution on them; ^qAsad4341


And if We take thee away, We surely shall take vengeance on them, ^qPickthall4341


Whether We take thee away, We shall take vengeance upon them, ^qArberry4341

# 42

Aw nuriyannakal lazee wa'adnaahum fa innaa 'alaihim muqtadiroon ^qTrans4342


and whether We show thee [or do not show thee in this world] the fulfillment of what We have promised them - verily, We have full power over them! ^qAsad4342


Or (if) We show thee that wherewith We threaten them; for lo! We have complete command of them. ^qPickthall4342


or We show thee a part of that We promised them, surely We have power over them. ^qArberry4342

# 43

Fastamsik billazeee oohi ya ilaika innaka 'alaa Siraatim Mustaqeem ^qTrans4343


So hold fast to all that has been revealed to thee: for, behold, thou art on a straight way; ^qAsad4343


So hold thou fast to that which is inspired in thee. Lo! thou art on a right path. ^qPickthall4343


So hold thou fast unto that which has been revealed unto thee; surely thou art upon a straight path. ^qArberry4343

# 44

Wa innahoo lazikrul laka wa liqawmika wa sawfa tus'aloon ^qTrans4344


and, verily, this [revelation] shall indeed become [a source of] eminence for thee and thy people: but in time you all will be called to account [for what you have done with it]. ^qAsad4344


And lo! it is in truth a Reminder for thee and for thy folk; and ye will be questioned. ^qPickthall4344


Surely it is a Reminder to thee and to thy people; and assuredly you will be questioned. ^qArberry4344

# 45
