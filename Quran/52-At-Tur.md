# 27

Famannnal laahu 'alainaa wa waqaanaa 'azaabas samoom ^qTrans5227


and so God has graced us with His favour, and has warded off from us all suffering through the scorching winds [of frustration]. ^qAsad5227


But Allah hath been gracious unto us and hath preserved us from the torment of the breath of Fire. ^qPickthall5227

# 28

Innaa kunnaa min qablu nad'oohu innahoo huwal barrur raheem ^qTrans5228


Verily, we did invoke Him [alone] ere this: [and now He has shown us] that He alone is truly benign, a true dispenser of grace!” ^qAsad5228


Lo! we used to pray unto Him of old. Lo! He is the Benign, the Merciful. ^qPickthall5228

# 30

Am yaqooloona shaa'irun natarabbasu bihee raibal manoon ^qTrans5230


Or do they say, “[He is but] a poet - let us wait what time will do unto him”? ^qAsad5230

# 32

Am taamuruhum ahlaamuhum bihaazaaa am hum qawmun taaghoon ^qTrans5232


Is it their minds that bid them [to take] this [attitude] - or are they [simply] people filled with overweening arrogance? ^qAsad5232


Do their minds command them to do this, or are they an outrageous folk? ^qPickthall5232


Or do their intellects bid them do this? Or are they an insolent people? ^qArberry5232

# 33

Am yaqooloona taqawwalah; bal laa yu'minoon ^qTrans5233


Or do they say, “He himself has composed this [message]”? Nay, but they are not willing to believe! ^qAsad5233

Falyaatoo bihadeesim misliheee in kaanoo saadiqeen ^qTrans5234


But then, [if they deem it the work of a mere mortal,] let them produce another discourse like it - if what they say be true! ^qAsad5234

# 35

Am khuliqoo min ghairi shai'in am humul khaaliqoon ^qTrans5235


[Or do they deny the existence of God?] Have they themselves been created without anything [that might have caused their creation]? or were they, perchance, their own creators? ^qAsad5235


Or were they created out of naught? Or are they the creators? ^qPickthall5235


Or were they created out of nothing? Or are they the creators? ^qArberry5235

# 36

Am khalaqus samaawaati wal ard; bal laa yooqinoon ^qTrans5236

# 37

Am'indahum khazaaa'inu rabbika am humul musaitiroon ^qTrans5237


[How could they?] Are thy Sustainer’s treasures with them? Or are they in charge [of destiny]? ^qAsad5237


Or do they own the treasures of thy Lord? Or have they been given charge (thereof)? ^qPickthall5237


Or are thy Lord's treasuries in their keeping? Or are they the registrars? ^qArberry5237

# 38

Am lahum sullamuny yastami'oona feehi falyaati mustami'uhum bisultaanim mubeen ^qTrans5238


Or have they a ladder by which they could [ascend to ultimate truths and] listen [to what is beyond the reach of human perception]? Let, then, any of them who have listened [to it] produce a manifest proof [of his knowledge]! ^qAsad5238


Or have they any stairway (unto heaven) by means of which they overhear (decrees). Then let their listener produce some warrant manifest! ^qPickthall5238


Or have they a ladder whereon they listen? Then let any of them that has listened bring a clear authority. ^qArberry5238

# 39

Am lahul banaatu wa lakumul banoon ^qTrans5239


Or, [if you believe in God, how can you believe that] He has [chosen to have] daughters, whereas you yourselves would have [only] sons? ^qAsad5239

Or has He daughters, and they sons? ^qArberry5239

# 40

Am tas'aluhum ajran fahum mim maghramim musqaloon ^qTrans5240


Or is it that [they who reject thy message, O Muhammad, fear lest] thou ask of them a reward, so that they would be burdened with debt [if they should listen to thee]? ^qAsad5240


Or askest thou (Muhammad) a fee from them so that they are plunged in debt? ^qPickthall5240


Or askest thou them for a wage, and so they are weighed down with debt? ^qArberry5240

# 41

Am 'indahumul ghaibu fahum yaktuboon ^qTrans5241


Or [do they think] that the hidden reality [of all that exists] is almost within their grasp, so that [in time] they can write it down? ^qAsad5241


Or possess they the Unseen so that they can write (it) down? ^qPickthall5241


Or is the Unseen in their keeping, and so they are writing it down? ^qArberry5241

# 42

Am yureedoona kaidan fallazeena kafaroo humul makeedoon ^qTrans5242


Or do they want to entrap [thee in contradic­tions]? But they who are bent on denying the truth - it is they who are truly entrapped! ^qAsad5242


Or seek they to ensnare (the messenger)? But those who disbelieve, they are the ensnared! ^qPickthall5242


Or desire they to outwit? The unbelievers, they are the outwitted. ^qArberry5242

# 43

Am lahum ilaahun ghairul laa; subhaanal laahi 'ammaa yushrikoon ^qTrans5243


Have they, then, any deity other than God? Utterly remote is God, in His limitless glory, from anything to which men may ascribe a share in His divinity! ^qAsad5243


Or have they any god beside Allah? Glorified be Allah from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him)! ^qPickthall5243


Or have they a god, other than God? Glory be to God, above that which they associate! ^qArberry5243

# 44

Wa iny yaraw kisfam minas samaaa'i saaqitany yaqooloo sahaabum markoom ^qTrans5244


AND YET, if they [who refuse to see the truth] were to see part of the sky falling down, they would [only] say, “[It is but] a mass of clouds!” ^qAsad5244


And if they were to see a fragment of the heaven falling, they would say: A heap of clouds. ^qPickthall5244


Even if they saw lumps falling from heaven, they would say, 'A massed cloud!' ^qArberry5244

# 45

Fazarhum hatta yulaaqoo yawmahumul lazee feehi yus'aqoon ^qTrans5245


Hence, leave them alone until they face that [Judgment] Day of theirs, when they will be stricken with terror: ^qAsad5245


Then let them be (O Muhammad), till they meet their day, in which they will be thunder-stricken, ^qPickthall5245


Then leave them, till they encounter their day wherein they shall be thunderstruck, ^qArberry5245

# 46

Yawma laa yughnee 'anhum kaidumhum shai'anw wa laa hum yunsaroon ^qTrans5246


the Day when none of their scheming will be of the least avail to them, and they will receive no succour. ^qAsad5246


A day in which their guile will naught avail them, nor will they be helped. ^qPickthall5246


the day when their guile shall avail them naught, and they shall not be helped. ^qArberry5246

# 47

Wa inna lillazeena zalamoo 'azaaban doona zalika wa laakinna aksarahum laa ya'lamoon ^qTrans5247


But, verily, for those who are bent on doing evil, there is suffering in store [even] closer at hand than that [supreme suffering in the hereafter]: but most of them are not aware of it. ^qAsad5247


And verily, for those who do wrong, there is a punishment beyond that. But most of them know not. ^qPickthall5247


And there surely awaits the evildoers a chastisement beyond even that, but most of them know it not. ^qArberry5247

# 48

Wasbir lihukmi rabbika fa innaka bi-a'yuninaa wa sabbih bihamdi rabbika heena taqoom ^qTrans5248


And so, await in patience thy Sustainer’s judgment, for thou art well within Our sight. And extol thy Sustainer’s limitless glory and praise whenever thou risest up, ^qAsad5248


So wait patiently (O Muhammad) for thy Lord's decree, for surely thou art in Our sight; and hymn the praise of thy Lord when thou uprisest, ^qPickthall5248


And be thou patient under the judgment of thy Lord; surely thou art before Our eyes. And proclaim the praise of thy Lord when thou arisest, ^qArberry5248

# 49

Wa minal laili fasabbihhu wa idbaaran nujoom ^qTrans5249


and extol His glory at night, and at the time when the stars retreat. ^qAsad5249


And in the night-time also hymn His praise, and at the setting of the stars. ^qPickthall5249


and proclaim the praise of thy Lord in the night, and at the declining of the stars. ^qArberry5249
