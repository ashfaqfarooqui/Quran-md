# 32

Am taamuruhum ahlaamuhum bihaazaaa am hum qawmun taaghoon ^qTrans5131


Is it their minds that bid them [to take] this [attitude] - or are they [simply] people filled with overweening arrogance? ^qAsad5131

# 35

Am khuliqoo min ghairi shai'in am humul khaaliqoon ^qTrans5134


[Or do they deny the existence of God?] Have they themselves been created without anything [that might have caused their creation]? or were they, perchance, their own creators? ^qAsad5134


Or were they created out of naught? Or are they the creators? ^qPickthall5134


Or were they created out of nothing? Or are they the creators? ^qArberry5134

# 36

# 37

Am'indahum khazaaa'inu rabbika am humul musaitiroon ^qTrans5136


[How could they?] Are thy Sustainer’s treasures with them? Or are they in charge [of destiny]? ^qAsad5136


Or do they own the treasures of thy Lord? Or have they been given charge (thereof)? ^qPickthall5136


Or are thy Lord's treasuries in their keeping? Or are they the registrars? ^qArberry5136

# 38

Am lahum sullamuny yastami'oona feehi falyaati mustami'uhum bisultaanim mubeen ^qTrans5137


Or have they a ladder by which they could [ascend to ultimate truths and] listen [to what is beyond the reach of human perception]? Let, then, any of them who have listened [to it] produce a manifest proof [of his knowledge]! ^qAsad5137


Or have they any stairway (unto heaven) by means of which they overhear (decrees). Then let their listener produce some warrant manifest! ^qPickthall5137

Am tas'aluhum ajran fahum mim maghramim musqaloon ^qTrans5139


Or is it that [they who reject thy message, O Muhammad, fear lest] thou ask of them a reward, so that they would be burdened with debt [if they should listen to thee]? ^qAsad5139


Or askest thou (Muhammad) a fee from them so that they are plunged in debt? ^qPickthall5139


Or askest thou them for a wage, and so they are weighed down with debt? ^qArberry5139

# 41

Am 'indahumul ghaibu fahum yaktuboon ^qTrans5140


Or [do they think] that the hidden reality [of all that exists] is almost within their grasp, so that [in time] they can write it down? ^qAsad5140


Or possess they the Unseen so that they can write (it) down? ^qPickthall5140


Or is the Unseen in their keeping, and so they are writing it down? ^qArberry5140

# 42

Am yureedoona kaidan fallazeena kafaroo humul makeedoon ^qTrans5141


Or do they want to entrap [thee in contradic­tions]? But they who are bent on denying the truth - it is they who are truly entrapped! ^qAsad5141


Or seek they to ensnare (the messenger)? But those who disbelieve, they are the ensnared! ^qPickthall5141


Or desire they to outwit? The unbelievers, they are the outwitted. ^qArberry5141

# 43

Am lahum ilaahun ghairul laa; subhaanal laahi 'ammaa yushrikoon ^qTrans5142


Have they, then, any deity other than God? Utterly remote is God, in His limitless glory, from anything to which men may ascribe a share in His divinity! ^qAsad5142


Or have they any god beside Allah? Glorified be Allah from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him)! ^qPickthall5142


Or have they a god, other than God? Glory be to God, above that which they associate! ^qArberry5142

# 44

Wa iny yaraw kisfam minas samaaa'i saaqitany yaqooloo sahaabum markoom ^qTrans5143


AND YET, if they [who refuse to see the truth] were to see part of the sky falling down, they would [only] say, “[It is but] a mass of clouds!” ^qAsad5143


And if they were to see a fragment of the heaven falling, they would say: A heap of clouds. ^qPickthall5143


Even if they saw lumps falling from heaven, they would say, 'A massed cloud!' ^qArberry5143

# 45

Fazarhum hatta yulaaqoo yawmahumul lazee feehi yus'aqoon ^qTrans5144


Hence, leave them alone until they face that [Judgment] Day of theirs, when they will be stricken with terror: ^qAsad5144


Then let them be (O Muhammad), till they meet their day, in which they will be thunder-stricken, ^qPickthall5144


Then leave them, till they encounter their day wherein they shall be thunderstruck, ^qArberry5144

# 46

Yawma laa yughnee 'anhum kaidumhum shai'anw wa laa hum yunsaroon ^qTrans5145


the Day when none of their scheming will be of the least avail to them, and they will receive no succour. ^qAsad5145


A day in which their guile will naught avail them, nor will they be helped. ^qPickthall5145


the day when their guile shall avail them naught, and they shall not be helped. ^qArberry5145

# 47

Wa inna lillazeena zalamoo 'azaaban doona zalika wa laakinna aksarahum laa ya'lamoon ^qTrans5146


But, verily, for those who are bent on doing evil, there is suffering in store [even] closer at hand than that [supreme suffering in the hereafter]: but most of them are not aware of it. ^qAsad5146


And verily, for those who do wrong, there is a punishment beyond that. But most of them know not. ^qPickthall5146


And there surely awaits the evildoers a chastisement beyond even that, but most of them know it not. ^qArberry5146

# 48

Wasbir lihukmi rabbika fa innaka bi-a'yuninaa wa sabbih bihamdi rabbika heena taqoom ^qTrans5147


And so, await in patience thy Sustainer’s judgment, for thou art well within Our sight. And extol thy Sustainer’s limitless glory and praise whenever thou risest up, ^qAsad5147


So wait patiently (O Muhammad) for thy Lord's decree, for surely thou art in Our sight; and hymn the praise of thy Lord when thou uprisest, ^qPickthall5147


And be thou patient under the judgment of thy Lord; surely thou art before Our eyes. And proclaim the praise of thy Lord when thou arisest, ^qArberry5147

# 49

Wa minal laili fasabbihhu wa idbaaran nujoom ^qTrans5148


and extol His glory at night, and at the time when the stars retreat. ^qAsad5148


And in the night-time also hymn His praise, and at the setting of the stars. ^qPickthall5148


and proclaim the praise of thy Lord in the night, and at the declining of the stars. ^qArberry5148
