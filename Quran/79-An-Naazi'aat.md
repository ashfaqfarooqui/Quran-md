Lo! herein is indeed a lesson for him who feareth. ^qPickthall7926


Surely in that is a lesson for him who fears! ^qArberry7926

# 27

A-antum a shaddu khalqan amis samaa-u banaaha. ^qTrans7927


[O MEN!] Are you more difficult to create than the heaven which He has built? ^qAsad7927


Are ye the harder to create, or is the heaven that He built? ^qPickthall7927


What, are you stronger in constitution or the heaven He built? ^qArberry7927

# 28

Raf'a sam kaha fasaw waaha ^qTrans7928


High has He reared its vault and formed it in accordance with what it was meant to be; ^qAsad7928


He raised the height thereof and ordered it; ^qPickthall7928


He lifted up its vault, and levelled it, ^qArberry7928

# 29

Wa aghtasha lailaha wa akhraja duhaaha. ^qTrans7929


and He has made dark its night and brought forth its light of day. ^qAsad7929


And He made dark the night thereof, and He brought forth the morn thereof. ^qPickthall7929


and darkened its night, and brought forth its forenoon; ^qArberry7929

# 30

Wal arda b'ada zaalika dahaaha. ^qTrans7930


And after that, the earth: wide has He spread its expanse, ^qAsad7930


And after that He spread the earth, ^qPickthall7930


and the earth-after that He spread it out, ^qArberry7930

# 31

Akhraja minha maa-aha wa mar 'aaha. ^qTrans7931


and has caused its waters to come out of it, and its pastures, ^qAsad7931


And produced therefrom the water thereof and the pasture thereof, ^qPickthall7931


therefrom brought forth its waters and its pastures, ^qArberry7931

# 32

Wal jibala arsaaha. ^qTrans7932


and has made the mountains firm: ^qAsad7932


And He made fast the hills, ^qPickthall7932


and the mountains He set firm, ^qArberry7932

# 33

Mataa'al lakum wali an 'aamikum. ^qTrans7933


[all this] as a means of livelihood for you and your animals. ^qAsad7933


A provision for you and for your cattle. ^qPickthall7933


an enjoyment for you and your flocks. ^qArberry7933

# 34

Fa-izaa jaaa'atit taaam matul kubraa. ^qTrans7934


AND SO, when the great overwhelming event [of, resurrection] comes to pass – ^qAsad7934


But when the great disaster cometh, ^qPickthall7934


Then, when the Great Catastrophe comes ^qArberry7934

# 35

Yauma Yata zakkarul insaanu ma sa'aa. ^qTrans7935


on that Day man will [clearly] remember all that he has ever wrought; ^qAsad7935


The day when man will call to mind his (whole) endeavour, ^qPickthall7935


upon the day when man shall remember what he has striven, ^qArberry7935

# 36

Wa burrizatil-jaheemu limany-yaraa. ^qTrans7936


and the blazing fire [of hell] will be lad open before all who [are destined to] see it. ^qAsad7936


And hell will stand forth visible to him who seeth, ^qPickthall7936


and Hell is advanced for whoever sees, ^qArberry7936

# 37

Fa ammaa man taghaa. ^qTrans7937


For, unto him who shall have transgressed the bounds of what is right, ^qAsad7937


Then, as for him who rebelled ^qPickthall7937


then as for him who was insolent ^qArberry7937

# 38

Wa aasaral hayaatad dunyaa ^qTrans7938


and preferred the life of this world [to the good of his soul], ^qAsad7938


And chose the life of the world, ^qPickthall7938


and preferred the present life, ^qArberry7938

# 39

Fa innal jaheema hiyal maawaa. ^qTrans7939


that blazing fire will truly be the goal! ^qAsad7939


Lo! hell will be his home. ^qPickthall7939


surely Hell shall be the refuge. ^qArberry7939

# 40

Wa ammaa man khaafa maqaama Rabbihee wa nahan nafsa 'anil hawaa ^qTrans7940


But unto him who shall have stood in fear of his Sustainer's Presence, and held back his inner self from base desires, ^qAsad7940


But as for him who feared to stand before his Lord and restrained his soul from lust, ^qPickthall7940


But as for him who feared the Station of his Lord and forbade the soul its caprice, ^qArberry7940

# 41

Fa innal jannata hiyal maawaa ^qTrans7941


paradise will truly be the goal! ^qAsad7941


Lo! the Garden will be his home. ^qPickthall7941


surely Paradise shall be the refuge. ^qArberry7941

# 42

Yas'aloonaka 'anis saa'ati ayyaana mursaahaa ^qTrans7942


THEY WILL ASK thee [O Prophet] about the Last Hour: "When will it come to pass?" ^qAsad7942


They ask thee of the Hour: when will it come to port? ^qPickthall7942


They will question thee concerning the Hour, when it shall berth. ^qArberry7942

# 43

Feema anta min zikraahaa ^qTrans7943


[But] how couldst thou tell anything about it, ^qAsad7943


Why (ask they)? What hast thou to tell thereof? ^qPickthall7943


What art thou about, to mention it? ^qArberry7943

# 44

Ilaa Rabbika muntahaa haa ^qTrans7944


[seeing that] with thy Sustainer alone rests the beginning and the end [of all knowledge] thereof? ^qAsad7944


Unto thy Lord belongeth (knowledge of) the term thereof. ^qPickthall7944


Unto thy Lord is the final end of it. ^qArberry7944

# 45

Innamaaa anta munziru maiy yakshaahaa ^qTrans7945


Thou art but [sent] to warn those who stand in awe of it. ^qAsad7945


Thou art but a warner unto him who feareth it. ^qPickthall7945


Thou art only the warner of him who fears it. ^qArberry7945

# 46

Ka annahum Yawma yarawnahaa lam yalbasooo illaa 'ashiyyatan aw duhaahaa ^qTrans7946


On the Day when they behold it, [it will seem to them] as if they had tarried [in this world] no longer than one evening or [one night, ending with] its morn! ^qAsad7946


On the day when they behold it, it will be as if they had but tarried for an evening or the morn thereof. ^qPickthall7946


It shall be as if; on the day they see it, they have but tarried for an evening, or its forenoon. ^qArberry7946
