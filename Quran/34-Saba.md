Alhamdu lillaahil lazee lahoo maa fis samaawaati wa maa fil ardi wa lahul hamdu fil aakhirah; wa Huwal Hakeemul Khabeer ^qTrans341


ALL PRAISE is due to God, to whom all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth belongs; and to Him will be due all praise in the life to come. For He alone is truly wise, all-aware: ^qAsad341


Praise be to Allah, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. His is the praise in the Hereafter, and He is the Wise, the Aware. ^qPickthall341


Praise belongs to God to whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. To Him belongs praise also in the Hereafter; He is the All-wise, the All-aware. ^qArberry341

# 2

Ya'lamu maa yaliju fil ardi wa maa yakhruju minhaa wa maa yanzilu minas samaaa'i wa maa ya'ruju feehaa; wa Huwar Raheemul Ghafoor ^qTrans342


He knows all that enters the earth, and all that comes out of it, as well as all that descends from the skies, and all that ascends to them. And He alone is a dispenser of grace, truly-forgiving. ^qAsad342


He knoweth that which goeth into the earth and that which cometh forth from it, and that descendeth from the heaven and that which ascendeth into it. He is the Merciful, the Forgiving. ^qPickthall342


He knows what penetrates into the earth, and what comes forth from it, what comes down from heaven, and what goes up to it; He is the All-compassionate, the All-forgiving. ^qArberry342

Wa qaalal lazeena kafaroo laa taateenas Saa'ah; qul balaa wa Rabbee lataatiyannakum 'Aalimul Ghaib; laa ya'zubu 'anhu misqaalu zarratin fis samaawaati wa laa fil ardi wa laaa asgharu min zaalika wa laaa akbaru illaa fee kitaabim mubeen ^qTrans343


And yet, they who are bent on denying the truth assert, “Never will the Last Hour come upon us!” Say: “Nay, by my Sustainer! By Him who knows all that is beyond the reach of a created being’s perception: it will most certainly come upon you!” Not an atom’s weight [of whatever there is] in the heavens or on earth escapes His knowledge; and neither is there anything smaller than that, or larger, but is recorded in [His] clear decree, ^qAsad343


Those who disbelieve say: The Hour will never come unto us. Say: Nay, by my Lord, but it is coming unto you surely. (He is) the Knower of the Unseen. Not an atom's weight, or less than that or greater, escapeth Him in the heavens or in the earth, but it is in a clear Record, ^qPickthall343


The unbelievers say, 'The Hour will never come to us.' Say: 'Yes indeed, by my Lord, it shall come to you, by Him who knows the Unseen; not so much as the weight of an ant in heaven and earth escapes from Him, neither is aught smaller than that, or greater, but it is in a Manifest Book; ^qArberry343

# 4

Liyajziyal lazeena aamanoo wa 'amilus saalihaat; ulaaa'ika lahum maghfiratunw wa rizqun kareem ^qTrans344


to the end that He may reward those who believe and do right­eous deeds: [for] it is they whom forgiveness of sins awaits, and a most excellent sustenance ^qAsad344


That He may reward those who believe and do good works. For them is pardon and a rich provision. ^qPickthall344


that He may recompense those who believe, and do righteous deeds; theirs shall be forgiveness and generous provision. ^qArberry344

# 5

Wallazeena sa'aw feee aayaatinaa mu'aajizeena ulaaa 'ika lahum 'azaabum mir irjzin aleem ^qTrans345


whereas for those who strive against Our messages, seeking to defeat their purpose, there is grievous suffering in store as an outcome of [their] vileness. ^qAsad345


But those who strive against Our revelations, challenging (Us), theirs will be a painful doom of wrath. ^qPickthall345


'And those who strive against Our signs to void them -- theirs shall be a chastisement of painful wrath.' ^qArberry345

# 6

Wa yaral lazeena utul 'Ilmal lazeee unzila ilaika mir Rabbika huwal haqqa wa yahdeee ilaaa siraatil 'Azeezil Hameed ^qTrans346


NOW THEY who are endowed with [innate] knowl­edge are well aware that whatever has been be­stowed upon thee from on high by thy Sustainer is indeed the truth, and that it guides onto the way that leads to the Almighty, the One to whom all praise is due! ^qAsad346


Those who have been given knowledge see that what is revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the truth and leadeth unto the path of the Mighty, the Owner of Praise. ^qPickthall346


Those who have been given the knowledge see that what has been sent down to thee from thy Lord is the truth, and guides to the path of the All-mighty, the All-laudable. ^qArberry346

# 7

Wa qaalal lazeena kafaroo hal nadullukum 'alaa rajuliny yanabbi 'ukum izaa muzziqtum kulla mumazzaqin innakum lafee khalqin jadeed ^qTrans347


As against this, they who are bent on denying the truth say [unto all who are of like mind]: “Shall we point out to you a man who will tell you that [after your death,] when you will have been scattered in countless fragments, you shall - lo and behold! - be [restored to life] in a new act of creation? ^qAsad347


Those who disbelieve say: Shall we show you a man who will tell you (that) when ye have become dispersed in dust with most complete dispersal still, even then, ye will be created anew? ^qPickthall347


The unbelievers say, 'Shall we point you to a man who will tell you, when you have been utterly torn to pieces, then you shall be in a new creation?' ^qArberry347

# 8

Aftaraa 'alal laahi kaziban am bihee jinnah; balil lazeena laa yu'minoona bil Aakhirati fil'azaabi waddad laalil ba'eed ^qTrans348


Does he [knowingly] attribute his own lying inventions to God - or is he a madman?” Nay, [there is no madness in this Prophet -] but they who will not believe in the life to come are [bound to lose themselves] in suffering and in a profound aberration. ^qAsad348


Hath he invented a lie concerning Allah, or is there in him a madness? Nay, but those who disbelieve in the Hereafter are in torment and far error. ^qPickthall348


What, has he forged against God a lie, or is he possessed? Not so; but those who believe not in the Hereafter are in chastisement and far error. ^qArberry348

# 9

Afalam yaraw ilaa maa baina aydeehim wa maa khalfahum minas samaaa'i wal ard; in nashad nakhsif bihimul arda aw nusqit 'alaihim kisafam minas samaaa'; inna fee zaalika la Aayatal likulli 'abdim muneeb ^qTrans349


Are they, then, not aware of how little of the sky and the earth lies open before them, and how much is hidden from them? [or that,] if We so willed, We could cause the earth to swallow them, or cause fragments of the sky to fall down upon them? In all this, behold, there is a message indeed for every servant [of God] who is wont to turn unto Him [in repentance]. ^qAsad349


Have they not observed what is before them and what is behind them of the sky and the earth? If We will, We can make the earth swallow them, or cause obliteration from the sky to fall on them. Lo! herein surely is a portent for every slave who turneth (to Allah) repentant. ^qPickthall349


Have they not regarded what lies before them and what lies behind them of heaven and earth? Did We will, We would make the earth to swallow them, or We would drop down on them lumps from heaven. Surely in that is a sign to every penitent servant. ^qArberry349

# 10

Wa laqad aatainaa Daawooda minnaa fadlany yaa jibaalu awwibee ma'ahoo wattaira wa alannaa lahul hadeed ^qTrans3410


AND [thus], indeed, did We grace David with Our favour: “O you mountains! Sing with him the praise of God! And [likewise] you birds!” And We softened all sharpness in him, ^qAsad3410


And assuredly We gave David grace from Us, (saying): O ye hills and birds, echo his psalms of praise! And We made the iron supple unto him, ^qPickthall3410


And We gave David bounty from Us: 'O you mountains, echo God's praises with him, and you birds!' And We softened for him iron: ^qArberry3410

# 11

Ani'mal saabighaatinw wa qaddir fis sardi wa'maloo saalihan innee bimaa ta'maloona Baseer ^qTrans3411


[and inspired him thus:] “Do good deeds lavishly, without stint, and give deep thought to their steady flow.” And [thus should you all, O believers,] do righteous deeds: for, verily, I see all that you do! ^qAsad3411


Saying: Make thou long coats of mail and measure the links (thereof). And do ye right. Lo! I am Seer of what ye do. ^qPickthall3411


'Fashion wide coats of mail, and measure well the links. ' -- And do ye righteousness, for surely I see the things you do. ^qArberry3411

# 12

Wa li-Sulaimaanar reeha ghuduwwuhaa shahrunw wa ra-waahuhaa shahrunw wa asalnaa lahoo 'ainal qitr; wa minal jinni mai ya'malu baina yadaihi bi izni Rabbih; wa mai yazigh minhum 'an amrinaa nuziqhu min 'azaabis sa'eer ^qTrans3412


AND UNTO Solomon [We made subservient] the wind: its morning course [covered the distance of] a month’s journey, and its evening course, a month’s journey. And We caused a fountain of molten copper to flow at his behest; and [even] among the invisible beings there were some that had [been constrained] to labour for him by his Sustainer’s leave and whichever of them deviated from Our command, him would We let taste suffering through a blazing flame -: ^qAsad3412


And unto Solomon (We gave) the wind, whereof the morning course was a month's journey and the evening course a month's journey, and We caused the fount of copper to gush forth for him, and (We gave him) certain of the jinn who worked before him by permission of his Lord. And such of them as deviated from Our command, them We caused to taste the punishment of flaming Fire. ^qPickthall3412


And to Solomon the wind; its morning course was a month's journey, and its evening course was a month's journey. And We made the Fount of Molten Brass to flow for him. And of the jinn, some worked before him by the leave of his Lord; and such of them as swerved away from Our commandment, We would let them taste the chastisement of the Blaze; ^qArberry3412

# 13

Ya'maloona lahoo ma yashaaa'u mim mahaareeba wa tamaaseela wa jifaanin kaljawaabi wa qudoorir raasiyaat; i'maloo aala Daawooda shukraa; wa qaleelum min 'ibaadiyash shakoor ^qTrans3413


they made for him whatever he wished of sanctuaries, and statues, and basins as [large as] great watering - troughs, and cauldrons firmly anchored. [And We said:] “Labour, O David’s people, in gratitude [towards Me] and [remember that] few are the truly grateful [even] among My servants!” ^qAsad3413


They made for him what he willed: synagogues and statues, basins like wells and boilers built into the ground. Give thanks, O House of David! Few of My bondmen are thankful. ^qPickthall3413


fashioning for him whatsoever he would -- places of worship, statues, porringers like water-troughs, and anchored cooking-pots. 'Labour, O House of David, in thankfulness; for few indeed are those that are thankful among My servants.' ^qArberry3413

# 14

Falammaa qadainaa 'alaihil mawta ma dallahum 'alaa mawtiheee illaa daaabbatul ardi taakulu minsa atahoo falammaa kharra tabaiyanatil jinnu al law kaanoo ya'lamoonal ghaiba maa labisoo fil 'azaabil muheen ^qTrans3414


Yet [even Solomon had to die; but] when We decreed that he should die, nothing showed them that he was dead except an earthworm that gnawed away his staff. And when he fell to the ground, those invisible beings [subservient to him] saw clearly that, had they but understood the reality which was be­yond the reach of their perception, they would not have continued [to toil] in the shameful suffering [of servitude] ^qAsad3414


And when We decreed death for him, nothing showed his death to them save a creeping creature of the earth which gnawed away his staff. And when he fell the jinn saw clearly how, if they had known the Unseen, they would not have continued in despised toil. ^qPickthall3414


And when We decreed that he should die, naught indicated to them that he was dead but the Beast of the Earth devouring his staff; and when he fell down, the jinn saw clearly that, had they only known the Unseen, they would not have continued in the humbling chastisement. ^qArberry3414

# 15

Laqad kaana li Saba-in fee maskanihim Aayatun jannataani 'ai yameeninw wa shimaalin kuloo mir rizq Rabbikum washkuroolah; baldatun taiyibatunw wa Rabbun Ghafoor ^qTrans3415


INDEED, in [the luxuriant beauty of] their homeland, the people of Sheba had an evidence [of God’s grace] two [vast expanses of] gardens, to the right and to the left, [calling out to them, as it were:] “Eat of what your Sustainer has provided for you, and render thanks unto Him: a land most goodly, and a Sustainer much-forgiving!” ^qAsad3415


There was indeed a sign for Sheba in their dwelling-place: Two gardens on the right hand and the left (as who should say): Eat of the provision of your Lord and render thanks to Him. A fair land and an indulgent Lord! ^qPickthall3415


For Sheba also there was a sign in their dwelling-place -- two gardens, one on the right and one on the left: 'Eat of your Lord's provision, and give thanks to Him; a good land, and a Lord All-forgiving.' ^qArberry3415

# 16

Fa-a''radoo fa-arsalnaa 'alaihim Sailal 'Arimi wa baddalnaahum bijannataihim jannataini azwaatai ukulin khamtinw wa aslinw wa shai'im min sidrin qaleel ^qTrans3416


But they turned away [from Us], and so We let loose upon them a flood that overwhelmed the dams, and changed their two [expanses of luxuriant] gardens into a couple of gardens yielding bitter fruit, and tamarisks, and some few [wild] lote-trees: ^qAsad3416


But they were froward, so We sent on them the flood of 'Iram, and in exchange for their two gardens gave them two gardens bearing bitter fruit, the tamarisk and here and there a lote-tree. ^qPickthall3416


But they turned away; so We loosed on them the Flood of Arim, and We gave them, in exchange for their two gardens, two gardens bearing bitter produce and tamarisk-bushes, and here and there a few lote-trees. ^qArberry3416

# 17

Zaalika jazainaahum bimaa kafaroo wa hal nujaazeee illal kafoor ^qTrans3417


thus We requited them for their having denied the truth. But do We ever requite [thus] any but the utterly ingrate? ^qAsad3417


This We awarded them because of their ingratitude. Punish We ever any save the ingrates? ^qPickthall3417


Thus We recompensed them for their unbelief; and do 'We ever recompense any hut the unbeliever? ^qArberry3417

# 18

Wa ja'alnaa bainahum wa bainal qural latee baaraknaa feehaa quran zaahiratanw wa qaddamaa feehas sayr; seeroo feehaa la yaalirya wa aiyaaman aamineen ^qTrans3418


Now [before their downfall,] We had placed between them and the cities which We had blessed [many] towns within sight of one another; and thus We had made traveling easy [for them, as if to say]: “Travel safely in this [land], by night or by day!” ^qAsad3418


And We set, between them and the towns which We had blessed, towns easy to be seen, and We made the stage between them easy, (saying): Travel in them safely both by night and day. ^qPickthall3418


And We set, between them and the cities that We have blessed, cities apparent and well We measured the journey between them: 'Journey among them by night and day in security!' ^qArberry3418

# 19

Faqaaloo Rabbanaa baa'id baina asfaarinaa wa zalamooo anfusahum faja'alnaahum ahaadeesa wa mazzaq naahum kulla mumazzaq; inna fee zaalika la Aayaatil likulli sabbaarin shakoor ^qTrans3419


But now they would say, “Long has our Sus­tainer made the distance between our journey- stages!” - for they had sinned against themselves. And in the end We caused them to become [one of those] tales [of things long past], and scattered them in countless fragments. Herein, behold, there are messages indeed for all who are wholly patient in adversity and deeply grate­ful [to God]. ^qAsad3419


But they said: Our Lord! Make the stage between our journeys longer. And they wronged themselves, therefore We made them bywords (in the land) and scattered them abroad, a total scattering. Lo! herein verily are portents for each steadfast, grateful (heart). ^qPickthall3419


But they said, 'Our Lord, prolong the stages of our travel'; and they wronged themselves, so We made them as but tales, and We tore them utterly to pieces. Surely in that are signs for every man enduring, thankful. ^qArberry3419

# 20

Wa laqad saddaq 'alaihim Ibleesu zannnabhoo fattaba'oohu illaa fareeqam minal mu'mineen ^qTrans3420


Now, indeed, Iblis did prove that his opinion of them had been right: for [when he called them,] they followed him - all but some of the believers [among them]. ^qAsad3420


And Satan indeed found his calculation true concerning them, for they follow him, all save a group of true believers. ^qPickthall3420


Iblis proved true his opinion of them, and they followed him, except a party of the believers. ^qArberry3420

# 21

Wa maa kaana lahoo 'alaihim min sultaanin illaa lina'lama mai yu minu bil Aakhirati mimman huwa minhaa fee shakk; wa Rabbuka 'alaa kulli shai'in Hafeez ^qTrans3421


And yet, he had no power at all over them: [for if We allow him to tempt man,] it is only to the end that We might make a clear distinction between those who [truly] believe in the life to come and those who are in doubt thereof: for thy Sustainer watches over all things. ^qAsad3421


And he had no warrant whatsoever against them, save that We would know him who believeth in the Hereafter from him who is in doubt thereof; and thy Lord (O Muhammad) taketh note of all things. ^qPickthall3421


Yet he had no authority over them, but that We might know him who believed in the Hereafter from him who was in doubt thereof Thy Lord is Guardian over everything. ^qArberry3421

# 22

Qulid 'ul lazeena za'amtum min doonil laahi laa yamlikoona misqaala zarratin fissamaawaati wa laa fil ardi wa maa lahum feehimaa min shirkinw wa maa lahoo minhum min zaheer ^qTrans3422


SAY: “Call upon those [beings] whom you imagine [to be endowed with divine powers] beside God: they have not an atom’s weight of power either in the heavens or on earth, nor have they any share in [governing] either, nor does He [choose to] have any helper from among them.” ^qAsad3422


Say (O Muhammad): Call upon those whom ye set up beside Allah! They possess not an atom's weight either in the heavens or in the earth, nor have they any share in either, nor hath He an auxiliary among them. ^qPickthall3422


Say: 'Call on those you have asserted apart from God; they possess not so much as the weight of an ant in the heavens nor in the earth; they have no partnership in either of them, nor has He in them any supporter.' ^qArberry3422

# 23

Wa laa tanfa'ush shafaa'atu 'indahooo illaa liman azina lah; hattaaa izaa fuzzi'a 'an quloobihim qaaloo maazaa qaala Rabbukum; qaalul haqq, wa Huwal 'Aliyul Kabeer ^qTrans3423


And, before Him, intercession can be of no avail [to any] save one in whose case He may have granted leave [there for]: so much so that when the terror [of the Last Hour] is lifted from their hearts, they [who have been resurrected] will ask [one an­other], “What has your Sustainer decreed [for you]?” - [to which] the others will answer, “Whatever is true and deserved - for He alone is exalted, great!” ^qAsad3423


No intercession availeth with Him save for him whom He permitteth. Yet, when fear is banished from their hearts, they say: What was it that your Lord said? They say: The Truth. And He is the Sublime, the Great. ^qPickthall3423


Intercession will not avail with Him save for him to whom He gives leave; till, when terror is lifted from their hearts, they will say, "What said your Lord?' They will say, 'The truth; and He is the All-high; the All-great.' ^qArberry3423

# 24

Qul mai yarzuqukum minas samaawaati wal ardi qulil laahu wa innaaa aw iyyaakum la'alaa hudan aw fee dalaalim mubeen ^qTrans3424


Say: “Who is it that provides for you sus­tenance out of the heavens and the earth?” Say: “It is God. And, behold, either we [who believe in Him] or you [who deny His oneness] are on the right path, or have clearly gone astray!” ^qAsad3424


Say: Who giveth you provision from the sky and the earth? Say: Allah, Lo! we or you assuredly are rightly guided or in error manifest. ^qPickthall3424


Say: 'Who provides for you out of the heavens and the earth?' Say: 'God.' Surely, either we or you are upon right guidance, or in manifest error. ^qArberry3424

# 25

Qul laa tus'aloona 'ammaaa ajramnaa wa laa nus'alu 'ammaa ta'maloon ^qTrans3425


Say: “Neither shall you be called to account for whatever we may have become guilty of, nor shall we be called to account for whatever you are doing.” ^qAsad3425


Say: Ye will not be asked of what we committed, nor shall we be asked of what ye do. ^qPickthall3425


Say: 'You will not be questioned concerning our sins, neither shall we be questioned as to what you do.' ^qArberry3425

# 26

Qul yajma'u bainanaa Rabbunaa summa yaftahu bainanaa bilhaqq; wa Huwal Fattaahul 'Aleem ^qTrans3426


Say: “Our Sustainer will bring us all together [on Judgment Day], and then He will lay open the truth between us, in justice - for He alone is the One who opens all truth, the All-Knowing!” ^qAsad3426


Say: Our Lord will bring us all together, then He will judge between us with truth. He is the All-knowing Judge. ^qPickthall3426


Say: 'Our Lord will bring us together, then make deliverance between us by the truth. He is the Deliverer, the All-knowing.' ^qArberry3426

# 27

Qul arooniyal lazeena alhaqtum bihee shurakaaa'a kallaa; bal Huwal Laahul 'Azeezul Hakeem ^qTrans3427


Say: “Point out to me those [beings] that you have joined with Him [in your minds] as partners [in His divinity]! Nay - nay, but He [alone] is God, the Almighty, the Wise!” ^qAsad3427


Say: Show me those whom ye have joined unto Him as partners. Nay (ye dare not)! For He is Allah, the Mighty, the Wise. ^qPickthall3427


Say: 'Show me those you have joined to Him as associates. No indeed; rather He is God, the All-mighty, the All-wise.' ^qArberry3427

# 28

Wa maaa arsalnaaka illaa kaaffatal linnaasi basheeranw wa nazeeranw wa laakinna aksaran naasi laa ya'lamoon ^qTrans3428


NOW [as for thee, O Muhammad,] We have not sent thee otherwise than to mankind at large, to be a herald of glad tidings and a warner; but most people do not understand [this], ^qAsad3428


And We have not sent thee (O Muhammad) save as a bringer of good tidings and a warner unto all mankind; but most of mankind know not. ^qPickthall3428


We have sent thee not, except to mankind entire, good tidings to bear, and warning; but most men do not know it. ^qArberry3428

# 29

Wa yaqooloona mataa haazal wa'du in kuntum saadiqeen ^qTrans3429


and so they ask, “When is this promise [of resurrection and judgment] to be fulfilled? [Answer this, O you who believe in it,] if you are men of truth!” ^qAsad3429


And they say: When is this promise (to be fulfilled) if ye are truthful? ^qPickthall3429


They say, 'When shall this promise come to pass, if you speak the truth?' ^qArberry3429

# 30

Qul lakum mee'aadu Yawmil laa tastaakhiroona 'anhu saa'atanw wa la tastaqdimoon ^qTrans3430


Say: “There has been appointed for you a Day, which you can neither delay nor advance by a single moment.” ^qAsad3430


Say (O Muhammad): Yours is the promise of a Day which ye cannot postpone nor hasten by an hour. ^qPickthall3430


Say: 'You have the tryst of a day that you shall not put back by a single hour nor put it forward.' ^qArberry3430

Wa qaalal lazeena kafaroo lan nu'mina bihaazal Quraani wa laa billazee baina yadayh; wa law taraaa iziz zaalimoona mawqoofoona 'inda Rabbihim yarji'u ba'duhum ilaa ba'dinil qawla yaqoolul lazeenas tud'ifoo lillazeenas takbaroo law laaa antum lakunnaa mu'mineen ^qTrans3431


And [yet,] those who are bent on denying the truth do say, “We shall never believe in this Qur’an, and neither in whatever there still remains of earlier revelations!” But if thou couldst only see [how it will be on Judgment Day,] when these evildoers shall be made to stand before their Sustainer, hurling reproaches back and forth at one another! Those [of them] who had been weak [on earth] will say unto those who had gloried in their arrogance: “Had it not been for you, we would certainly have been believers!” ^qAsad3431


And those who disbelieve say: We believe not in this Qur'an nor in that which was before it; but oh, if thou couldst see, when the wrong-doers are brought up before their Lord, how they cast the blame one to another; how those who were despised (in the earth) say unto those who were proud: But for you, we should have been believers. ^qPickthall3431


The unbelievers say, 'We will not believe in this Koran, nor in that before it.' Ah, if thou couldst see when the evildoers are stationed before their Lord, bandying argument the one against the other! Those that were abased will say to those that waxed proud, 'Had it not been for you, we would have been believers. ^qArberry3431

[And] those who were wont to glory in their arrogance will say unto those who had been weak: “Why - did we keep you [forcibly] from following the right path after it had become obvious to you? Nay, it was but you [yourselves] who were guilty!” ^qAsad3432


Those who were proud say unto those who were despised: Did we drive you away from the guidance after it had come unto you? Nay, but ye were guilty. ^qPickthall3432


Those that waxed proud will say to those that were abased, 'What, did we bar you from the guidance after it came to you? Nay, rather you were sinners.' ^qArberry3432

But those who had been weak will say unto those who had gloried in their arrogance: “Nay, [what kept us away was your] devising of false arguments, night and day, [against God’s messages- as you did] when you persuaded us to blaspheme against God and to claim that there are powers that could rival Him!” And when they see the suffering [that awaits them], they will [all] be unable to express [the full depth of] their remorse: for We shall have put shackles around the necks of those who had been bent on denying the truth: [and] will this be aught but a [just] requital for what they were doing? ^qAsad3433


Those who were despised say unto those who were proud: Nay but (it was your) scheming night and day, when ye commanded us to disbelieve in Allah and set up rivals unto Him. And they are filled with remorse when they behold the doom; and We place carcans on the necks of those who disbelieved. Are they requited aught save what they used to do? ^qPickthall3433


And those that were abased will say to those that waxed proud, 'Nay, but devising night and day, when you were ordering us to disbelieve in God, and to set up compeers to Him.' They will be secretly remorseful when they see the chastisement and We put fetters on the necks of the unbelievers; shall they be recompensed except for what they were doing? ^qArberry3433

Wa maaa arsalnaa' fee qaryatim min nazeerin illaa qaala mutrafooaa innaa bimaaa ursiltum bihee kaafiroon ^qTrans3434


For [thus it is:] whenever We sent a warner to any community, those of its people who had lost themselves entirely in the pursuit of pleasures would declare, “Behold, we deny that there is any truth in [what you claim to be] your message!” – ^qAsad3434


And We sent not unto any township a warner, but its pampered ones declared: Lo! we are disbelievers in that wherewith ye have been sent. ^qPickthall3434


We sent no warner into any city except its men who lived at ease said, 'We disbelieve in the Message you have been sent with.' ^qArberry3434

Wa qaaloo nahnu aksaru amwaalanw wa awlaadanw wa maa nahnu bimu 'azzabeen ^qTrans3435


and they would add, “Richer [than you] are we in wealth and in children, and [so] we are not going to be made to suffer!” ^qAsad3435


And they say: We are more (than you) in wealth and children. We are not the punished! ^qPickthall3435


They also said, 'We are more abundant in wealth and children, and we shall not be chastised.' ^qArberry3435

Say: “Behold, my Sustainer grants abundant sustenance, or gives it in scant measure, unto whomever He wills: but most men do not understand [God’s ways].” ^qAsad3436


Say (O Muhammad): Lo! my Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will and narroweth it (for whom He will). But most of mankind know not. ^qPickthall3436


Say: 'My Lord outspreads and straitens His provision to whomsoever He will, but most men do not know it.' ^qArberry3436

For, it is neither your riches nor your children that can bring you nearer to Us: only he who attains to faith and does what is right and just [comes near unto Us]; and it is [such as] these whom multiple recompense awaits for all that they have done; and it is they who shall dwell secure in the mansions [of paradise] – ^qAsad3437


And it is not your wealth nor your children that will bring you near unto Us, but he who believeth and doeth good (he draweth near). As for such, theirs will be twofold reward for what they did and they will dwell secure in lofty halls. ^qPickthall3437


It is not your wealth nor your children that shall bring you nigh in nearness to Us, except for him who believes, and does righteousness; those -- there awaits them the double recompense for that they did, and they shall be in the lofty chambers in security. ^qArberry3437

whereas all who strive against Our messages, seeking to defeat their purpose, shall be given over to suffering. ^qAsad3438


And as for those who strive against Our revelations, challenging, they will be brought to the doom. ^qPickthall3438


And those who strive against Our signs to void them -- those shall be arraigned into the chastisement. ^qArberry3438

Say: “Behold, my Sustainer grants abundant sustenance, or gives it in scant measure, unto whomever He wills of His servants; and whatever it be that you spend on others, He [always] replaces it: for He is the best of providers.” ^qAsad3439


Say: Lo! my Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will of His bondmen, and narroweth (it) for him. And whatsoever ye spend (for good) He replaceth it. And He is the Best of Providers. ^qPickthall3439


Say: 'My Lord outspreads and straitens His provision to whomsoever He will of His servants; and whatever thing you shall expend, He will replace it. He is the best of providers.' ^qArberry3439

And [as for those who now deny the truth,] one Day He will gather them all together, and will ask the angels, “Was it you that they were wont to worship?” ^qAsad3440


And on the day when He will gather them all together, He will say unto the angels: Did these worship you? ^qPickthall3440


Upon the day when He shall muster them all together, then He shall say to the angels, 'Was it you these were serving? ^qArberry3440

Qaaloo Subhaanaka Anta waliyyunaa min doonihim bal kaanoo ya'budoonal jinna aksaruhum bihim mu'minoon ^qTrans3441


They will answer: “Limitless art Thou in Thy glory! Thou [alone] art close unto us, not they! Nay, [when they thought that they were worshipping us,] they were but [blindly] worshipping forces concealed from their senses; most of them believed in them.” ^qAsad3441


They will say: Be Thou Glorified. Thou (alone) art our Guardian, not them! Nay, but they worshipped the jinn; most of them were believers in them. ^qPickthall3441


They shall say, 'Glory be to Thee'! Thou art our Protector, apart from them; nay rather, they were serving the jinn; most of them believed in them.' ^qArberry3441

Fal Yawma laa yamliku ba'dukum liba'din naf'anw wa laa darraa; wa naqoolu lilzeena zalamoo zooqoo 'azaaban Naaril latee kuntum bihaa tukazziboon ^qTrans3442


And [on that Day God will say]: “None of you [created beings] has today any power to benefit or to harm another!” And [then] We shall say unto those who had been bent on evildoing: “Taste [now] that suffering through fire which you were wont to call a lie!” ^qAsad3442


That day ye will possess no use nor hurt one for another. And We shall say unto those who did wrong: Taste the doom of the Fire which ye used to deny. ^qPickthall3442


'Therefore today none of you shall have power to profit or hurt another.' And We shall say to the evildoers, 'Taste the chastisement of the Fire, which you cried lies to!' ^qArberry3442

For [thus it is:] whenever Our messages are conveyed unto them in all their clarity, they [who are bent on denying the truth] say [to one another], “This [Muhammad] is nothing but a man who wants to turn you away from what your forefathers were wont to worship!” And they say, “This [Qur’an] is nothing but a falsehood invented [by man]!” And [finally,] they who are bent on denying the truth speak thus of the truth when it comes to them: “This is clearly nothing but spellbinding eloquence!” ^qAsad3443


And if Our revelations are recited unto them in plain terms, they say: This is naught else than a man who would turn you away from what your fathers used to worship; and they say: This is naught else than an invented lie. Those who disbelieve say of the truth when it reacheth them: This is naught else than mere magic. ^qPickthall3443


And when Our signs are recited to them, clear signs, they say, 'This is naught but a man who desires to bar you from that your fathers served'; and they say, 'This is nothing but a forged calumny.' And the unbelievers say to the truth, when it has come to them, 'This is nothing but manifest sorcery. ^qArberry3443

Wa maaa aatainaahum min Kutubiny yadrusoonahaa wa maaa arsalnaaa ilaihim qablaka min nazeer ^qTrans3444


And yet, [O Muhammad,] never have We vouchsafed them any revelations which they could quote, and neither have We sent unto them any warner before thee. ^qAsad3444


And We have given them no scriptures which they study, nor sent We unto them, before thee, any warner. ^qPickthall3444


We have not given them any Books to study, nor have We sent them before thee any warner. ^qArberry3444

Wa kazzabal lazeena min qablihim wa maa balaghoo mi'shaara maaa aatainaahum fakazzaboo Rusulee; fakaifa kaana nakeer ^qTrans3445


Thus, too, gave the lie to the truth [many of] those who lived before them; and although those [earlier people] had not attained to even a tenth of [the evidence of the truth] which We have vouch­safed unto these [late successors of theirs], yet when they gave the lie to My apostles, how awesome was My rejection! ^qAsad3445


Those before them denied, and these have not attained a tithe of that which We bestowed on them (of old); yet they denied My messengers. How intense then was My abhorrence (of them)! ^qPickthall3445


Those that were before them also cried lies, yet they reached not a tenth of what We gave them; they cried lies to My Messengers, and how was My horror! ^qArberry3445

Say: “I counsel you one thing only: Be [ever­ conscious of] standing before God, whether you are in the company of others or alone; and then bethink yourselves [that] there is no madness in [this pro­phet,] your fellow-man: he is only a warner to you of suffering severe to come.” ^qAsad3446


Say (unto them, O Muhammad): I exhort you unto one thing only: that ye awake, for Allah's sake, by twos and singly, and then reflect: There is no madness in your comrade. He is naught else than a warner unto you in face of a terrific doom. ^qPickthall3446


Say: 'I give you but one admonition, that you stand unto God, two by two and one by one, and then reflect: no madness is in your comrade. He is naught but a warner unto you, before a terrible chastisement.' ^qArberry3446

Say: Whatever reward I might have asked of you is yours. My reward is the affair of Allah only. He is Witness over all things. ^qPickthall3447

Say: Lo! my Lord hurleth the truth. (He is) the Knower of Things Hidden. ^qPickthall3448

Say: The Truth hath come, and falsehood showeth not its face and will not return. ^qPickthall3449

And say: We (now) believe therein. But how can they reach (faith) from afar off, ^qPickthall3452

When they disbelieved in it of yore. They aim at the unseen from afar off. ^qPickthall3453

And a gulf is set between them and that which they desire, as was done for people of their kind of old. Lo! they were in hopeless doubt. ^qPickthall3454
