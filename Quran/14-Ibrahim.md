Alif-Laaam-Raa; Kitaabun anzalnaahu ilaika litukhrijan-naasa minaz zulumaati ilan noori bi-izni Rabbihim ilaa siraatil 'Azeezil Hameed ^qTrans141


Alif. Lam. Ra. A DIVINE WRIT [is this -a revelation] which We have bestowed upon thee from on high in order that thou might bring forth all mankind, by their Sustainer's leave, out of the depths of darkness into the light: onto the way that leads to the Almighty, the One to whom all praise is due - ^qAsad141


Alif. Lam. Ra. (This is) a Scripture which We have revealed unto thee (Muhammad) that thereby thou mayst bring forth mankind from darkness unto light, by the permission of their Lord, unto the path of the Mighty, the Owner of Praise, ^qPickthall141


Alif Lam Ra. A Book We have sent down to thee that thou mayest bring forth mankind from the shadows to the light by the leave of their Lord, to the path of the All-mighty, the All-laudable, ^qArberry141

Allaahil lazee lahoo maa fis samaawaati wa maa fill ard; wa wailul lilkaafireena min 'azaabin shadeed ^qTrans142


to God, unto whom all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth belongs. But woe unto those who deny the truth: for suffering severe ^qAsad142


Allah, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. and woe unto the disbelievers from an awful doom; ^qPickthall142


God, to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And woe to the unbelievers for a terrible chastisement, ^qArberry142

Allazeena yastahibboo nal hayaatad dunyaa 'alal aakhirati wa yasuddoona 'ansabeelil laahi wa yabghoonahaa 'iwajaa; ulaaa 'ika fee dalaalim ba'eed ^qTrans143


awaits those who choose the life of this world as the sole object of their love, preferring it to [all thought of] the life to come, and who turn others away from the path of God and try to make it appear crooked. Such as these have indeed gone far astray! ^qAsad143


Those who love the life of the world more than the Hereafter, and debar (men) from the way of Allah and would have it crooked: such are far astray. ^qPickthall143


such as prefer the present life over the world to come, and bar from God's way, desiring to make it crooked -- they are in far error. ^qArberry143

Wa maaa arsalnaa mir Rasoolin illaa bilisaani qawmihee liyubaiyina lahum faiudillul laahu mai yashaaa'u wa yahde mai yashaaa'; wa Huwal 'Azeezul Hakeem ^qTrans144


AND NEVER have We sent forth any apostle otherwise than [with a message] in his own people's tongue, so that he might make [the truth] clear unto them; but God lets go astray him that wills [to go astray], and guides him that wills [to be guided] -for He alone is almighty, truly wise. ^qAsad144


And We never sent a messenger save with the language of his folk, that he might make (the message) clear for them. Then Allah sendeth whom He will astray, and guideth whom He will. He is the Mighty, the Wise. ^qPickthall144


And We have sent no Messenger save with the tongue of his people, that he might make all clear to them; then God leads astray whomsoever He will, and He guides whomsoever He will; and He is the All-mighty, the All-wise. ^qArberry144

Wa laqad arsalnaa Moosaa bi Aayaatinaa an akhrij qawmaka minaz zulumaati ilan noori wa zak kirhum bi ayyaamil laah; inna fee zaalika la aayaatil likulli sabbaarin shakoor ^qTrans145


And [thus], indeed, have We sent forth Moses with Our messages [and this Our command]: "Lead thy people out of the depths of darkness into the light, and remind them of the Days of God!" Verily, in this [reminder] there are messages indeed for all who are wholly patient in adversity and deeply grateful [to God]. ^qAsad145


We verily sent Moses with Our revelations, saying: Bring thy people forth from darkness unto light. And remind them of the days of Allah. Lo! therein are revelations for each steadfast, thankful (heart). ^qPickthall145


And We sent Moses with Our signs -- 'Bring forth thy people from the shadows to the light and remind thou them of the Days of God.' Surely in that are signs for every man enduring, thankful! ^qArberry145

Wa iz qaala Moosaa liqawmihiz kuroo ni'matal laahi 'alaikum iz anjaakum min Aali Fir'awna yasoomoo nakum sooo'al 'azaabi wa yuzabbihoona abnaaa'akum wa yastahyoona nisaaa'akum; wa fee zaalikum balaaa'um mir Rabbikum 'azeem ^qTrans146


And, lo Moses spoke [thus] unto his people: "Remember the blessings which God bestowed upon you when He saved you from Pharaoh's people who afflicted you with cruel suffering, and slaughtered your sons, and spared [only] your women -which was an awesome trial from your Sustainer. ^qAsad146


And (remind them) how Moses said unto his people: Remember Allah's favour unto you when He delivered you from Pharaoh's folk who were afflicting you with dreadful torment, and were slaying your sons and sparing your women; that was a tremendous trial from your Lord. ^qPickthall146


And when Moses said to his people, 'Remember God's blessing upon you when He delivered you from the folk of Pharaoh, who were visiting you with evil chastisement, slaughtering your sons, and sparing your women -- and in that was a grievous trial from your Lord. ^qArberry146

# 7

Wa iz ta azzana Rabbukum la'in shakartum la azeedannakum wa la'in kafartum inn'azaabee lashadeed ^qTrans147


And [remember the time] when your Sustainer made [this promise] known: 'If you are grateful [to Me], I shall most certainly give you more and more; but if you are ungrateful, verily, My chastisement will be severe indeed!"' ^qAsad147


And when your Lord proclaimed: If ye give thanks, I will give you more; but if ye are thankless, lo! My punishment is dire. ^qPickthall147


And when your Lord proclaimed, "If you are thankful, surely I will increase you, but if you are thankless My chastisement is surely terrible."' ^qArberry147

Wa qaala Moosaaa in takfurooo antum wa man fil ardi jamee'an fa innal laaha la Ghaniyyun Hameed ^qTrans148


And Moses added: "If you should [ever] deny the truth-you and whoever else lives on earth, all of you-[know that,] verily, God is indeed self-sufficient, ever to be praised!" ^qAsad148


And Moses said: Though ye and all who are in the earth prove thankless, lo! Allah verily is Absolute, Owner of Praise. ^qPickthall148


And Moses said, 'If you are thankless, you and whoso is on earth, all together, yet assuredly God is All-sufficient, All-laudable.' ^qArberry148

HAVE THE STORIES of those [deniers of the truth] who lived before you never yet come within your ken - [the stories of] the people of Noah, and of [the tribes of] `Ad and Thamud, and of those who came after them? None knows them [now] save God. There came unto them their apostles with all evidence of the truth -but they covered their mouths with their hands and answered: "Behold, we refuse to regard as true the message with which you [claim to] have been entrusted; and, behold, we are in grave doubt, amounting to suspicion, about [the meaning of] your call to us!" ^qAsad149


Hath not the history of those before you reached you: the folk of Noah, and (the tribes of) A'ad and Thamud, and those after them? None save Allah knoweth them. Their messengers came unto them with clear proofs, but they thrust their hands into their mouths, and said: Lo! we disbelieve in that wherewith ye have been sent, and lo! we are in grave doubt concerning that to which ye call us. ^qPickthall149


Has there not come to you the tidings of those who were before you -- the people of Noah, Ad, Thamood, and of those after them whom none knows but God? Their Messengers came to them with the clear signs; but they thrust their hands into their mouths, saying, 'We certainly disbelieve in the Message you have been sent with, and we are in doubt, concerning that you call us unto, disquieting.' ^qArberry149

Qaalat Rusuluhum afillaahi shakkun faatiris samaawaati wal ardi yad'ookum liyaghfira lakum min zunoobikum wa yu'akhkhirakum ilaaa ajalim musam maa; qaaloo in antum illaa basharum mislunaa tureedoona an tasuddoonaa 'ammaa kaana ya'budu aabaaa'unaa faatoonaa bisul taanim mubeen ^qTrans1410


Said the apostles sent unto them: "Can there be any doubt about [the existence and oneness of] God, the Originator of the heavens and the earth? It is He who calls unto you, so that He may forgive you [whatever is past] of your sins and grant you respite until a term [set by Him is fulfilled]." [But] they replied: "You are nothing but mortal men like ourselves! You want to turn us away from what our forefathers were wont to worship: well, then, bring us a clear proof [of your being God's message-bearers]!" ^qAsad1410


Their messengers said: Can there be doubt concerning Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He calleth you that He may forgive you your sins and reprieve you unto an appointed term. They said: Ye are but mortals like us, who would fain turn us away from what our fathers used to worship. Then bring some clear warrant. ^qPickthall1410


Their Messengers said, 'Is there any doubt regarding God, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, who calls you so that He may forgive you your sins, and defer you to a term stated?' They said, 'You are nothing but mortals, like us; you desire to bar us from that our fathers served; then bring us a manifest authority.' ^qArberry1410

# 11

Qaalat lahum Rusuluhum in nahnu illaa basharum mislukum wa laakinnal laaha yamunnu 'alaa mai yashaaa'u min 'ibaadihee wa maa kaana lanaaa an naatiyakum bisul taanin illaa bi iznil laah; wa 'alal laahi falyatawakkalil mu'minonn ^qTrans1411


Their apostles answered them: "True, we are nothing but mortal men like yourselves: but God bestows His favour upon whomever He wills of His servants. Withal, it is not within our power to bring you a proof [of our mission], unless it be by God's leave-and [so] it is in God that all believers must place their trust. ^qAsad1411


Their messengers said unto them: We are but mortals like you, but Allah giveth grace unto whom He will of His slaves. It is not ours to bring you a warrant unless by the permission of Allah. In Allah let believers put their trust! ^qPickthall1411


Their Messengers said to them, 'We are nothing but mortals, like you; but God is gracious unto whomsoever He will of His servants. It is not for us to bring you an authority save by the leave of God; and in God let the believers put all their trust. ^qArberry1411

Wa maa lanaa allaa natawakkala 'alal laahi wa qad hadaanaa subulanaa; wa lanasbiranna 'alaa maaa aazaitumoonaa; wa 'alal laahi falyatawakkalil mutawakkiloon ^qTrans1412


And how could we not place our trust in God, seeing that it is He who has shown us the path which we are to follow? "Hence, we shall certainly bear with patience whatever hurt you may do us: for, all who have trust [in His existence] must place their trust in God [alone]!" ^qAsad1412


How should we not put our trust in Allah when He hath shown us our ways? We surely will endure the hurt ye do us. In Allah let the trusting put their trust. ^qPickthall1412


And why should we not put our trust in God, seeing that He has guided us in our ways? We will surely endure patiently, whatever you hurt us; and in God let all put their trust who put their trust.' ^qArberry1412

Wa qaalal lazeena kafaroo li Rusulihim lanukhrijanna kum min aardinaaa aw lata'oo dunna fee millatinaa fa awhaaa ilaihim Rabbuhum lanuhlikannaz zalimeen ^qTrans1413


But they who denied the truth spoke [thus] unto their apostles: "We shall most certainly expel you from our land, unless you return forthwith to our ways. Whereupon their Sustainer revealed this to His apostles: "Most certainly shall We destroy these evildoers, ^qAsad1413


And those who disbelieved said unto their messengers: Verily we will drive you out from our land, unless ye return to our religion. Then their Lord inspired them, (saying): Verily we shall destroy the wrong-doers, ^qPickthall1413


The unbelievers said to their Messengers, 'We will assuredly expel you from our land, or you will surely return into our creed.' Then did their Lord reveal unto them: 'We will surely destroy the evildoers, ^qArberry1413

# 14

Wa lanuskinan nakumul arda mim ba'dihim; zaalika liman khaafa maqaamee wa khaafa wa'eed ^qTrans1414


and most certainly shall We cause you to dwell on earth [long] after they have passed away: this is [My promise] unto all who stand in awe of My presence, and stand in awe of My warning!" ^qAsad1414


And verily We shall make you to dwell in the land after them. This is for him who feareth My Majesty and feareth My threats. ^qPickthall1414


and We will surely make you to dwell in the land after them -- that, for him who fears My station and fears My threat.' ^qArberry1414

# 15

Wastaftahoo wa khaaba kullu jabbaarin 'aneed ^qTrans1415


And they prayed [to God] that the truth be made to triumph. And [thus it is:] every arrogant enemy of the truth shall be undone [in the life to come], ^qAsad1415


And they sought help (from their Lord) and every froward potentate was bought to naught; ^qPickthall1415


They sought a judgment; then was disappointed every froward tyrant -- ^qArberry1415

# 16

Minw waraaa'ihee jahannamu wa yusqaa mim maaa'in sadeed ^qTrans1416


with hell awaiting him; and he shall be made to drink of the water of most bitter distress, ^qAsad1416


Hell is before him, and he is made to drink a festering water, ^qPickthall1416


beyond him Gehenna, and he is given to drink of oozing pus, ^qArberry1416

# 17

Yatajarra'uhoo wa laa yakaadu yuseeghuhoo wa yaateehil mawtu min kulli makaaninw wa maa huwa bimaiyitinw wa minw waraaa'ihee 'azaabun ghaleez ^qTrans1417


gulping it [unceasingly,] little by little, and yet hardly able to swallow it. And death will beset him from every quarter - but he shall not die: for [yet more] severe suffering lies ahead of him. ^qAsad1417


Which he sippeth but can hardly swallow, and death cometh unto him from every side while yet he cannot die, and before him is a harsh doom. ^qPickthall1417


the which he gulps, and can scarce swallow, and death comes upon him from every side, yet he cannot die; and still beyond him is a harsh chastisement. ^qArberry1417

Masalul lazeena kafaroo bi Rabbihim a'maaluhum karamaadinish taddat bihir reehu fee yawmin 'aasif; laa yaqdiroona mimmaa kasaboo 'alaa shai'; zaalika huwad dalaalul ba'eed ^qTrans1418


[This, then, is] the parable of those who are bent on denying their Sustainer: all their works are as ashes which the wind blows about fiercely on a stormy day: [in the life to come,] they cannot achieve any benefit whatever from all [the good] that they may have wrought: for this [denial of God] is indeed the farthest one can go astray. ^qAsad1418


A similitude of those who disbelieve in their Lord: Their works are as ashes which the wind bloweth hard upon a stormy day. They have no control of aught that they have earned. That is the extreme failure. ^qPickthall1418


The likeness of those who disbelieve in their Lord: their works are as ashes, whereon the wind blows strong upon a tempestuous day; they have no power over that they have earned - that is the far error! ^qArberry1418

# 19

Alam tara annal laaha khalaqas samaawaati wal arda bilhaqq; iny yashaa yuzhibkum wa yaati bikhalqin jadeed ^qTrans1419


ART THOU NOT aware that God has created the heavens and the earth in accordance with [an inner] truth? He can, if He so wills, do away with you and bring forth a new mankind [in your stead]: ^qAsad1419


Hast thou not seen that Allah hath created the heavens and the earth with truth? If He will, He can remove you and bring (in) some new creation; ^qPickthall1419


Hast thou not seen that God created the heavens and the earth in truth? If He will, He can put you away and bring a new creation; ^qArberry1419

# 20

Wa maa zaalika 'alal laahi bi 'azeez ^qTrans1420


nor is this difficult for God. ^qAsad1420


And that is no great matter for Allah. ^qPickthall1420


that is surely no great matter for God. ^qArberry1420

# 21

Wa barazoo lillaahi jamee'an faqaalad du'afaaa'u lillazeenas takbarooo innaa kunnaa lakum taba'an fahal antum mughnoona 'annaa min 'azaabil laahi min shai'; qaaloo law hadaanal laahu lahadai naakum sawaaa'un 'alainaaa ajazi'naa am sabarnaa maa lanaa mim mahees ^qTrans1421


And all [mankind] will appear before God [on the Day of Judgment]; and then the weak will say unto those who had gloried in their arrogance: "Behold, We were but your followers: can you, then, relieve us of something of God's chastisement?" [And the others] will answer: "If God would but show us the way [to salvation], we would indeed guide you [towards it]. It is [now] all one, as far as we are concerned, whether we grieve impatiently or endure [our lot] with patience: there is no escape for us!" ^qAsad1421


They all come forth unto their Lord. Then those who were despised say unto those who were scornful: We were unto you a following, can ye then avert from us aught of Allah's doom? They say: Had Allah guided us, we should have guided you. Whether we rage or patiently endure is (now) all one for us; we have no place of refuge. ^qPickthall1421


They sally forth unto God, all together; then say the weak to those who waxed proud, 'We were your followers; will you avail us against the chastisement of God anything?' They say, 'If God had guided us, we would have guided you. Alike it is for us whether we cannot endure, or whether we are patient; we have no asylum.' ^qArberry1421

Wa qaalash Shaitaanu lammaa qudiyal amru innal laaha wa'adakum wa'dal haqqi wa wa'attukum faakhlaftukum wa maa kaana liya 'alaikum min sultaanin illaaa an da'awtukum fastajabtum lee falaa taloomoonee wa loomooo anfusakum maaa ana bimusrikhikum wa maaa antum bimusrikhiyya innee kafartu bimaaa ashraktumooni min qabl; innaz zaalimeena lahum azaabun aleem ^qTrans1422


And when everything will have been decided, Satan will say: "Behold, God promised you something that was bound to come true! I, too, held out [all manner of] promises to you -but I deceived you. Yet I had no power at all over you: I but called you-and you responded unto me. Hence, blame not me, but blame yourselves. It is not for me to respond to your cries, nor for you to respond to mine: for, behold, I have [always] refused to admit that there was any truth in your erstwhile belief that I had a share in God's divinity." Verily, for all evildoers there is grievous suffering in store. ^qAsad1422


And Satan saith, when the matter hath been decided: Lo! Allah promised you a promise of truth; and I promised you, then failed you. And I had no power over you save that I called unto you and ye obeyed me. So blame not, but blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can ye help me, Lo! I disbelieved in that which ye before ascribed to me. Lo! for wrong-doers is a painful doom. ^qPickthall1422


And Satan says, when the issue is decided, 'God surely promised you a true promise; and I promised you, then I failed you, for I had no authority over you, but that I called you, and you answered me. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves; I cannot aid you, neither can you aid me. I disbelieved in your associating me with God aforetime.' As for the evildoers, for them awaits a painful chastisement; ^qArberry1422

Wa udkhilal lazeena aamanoo wa 'amilus saalihaati Jannaatin tajree min tahtihal anhaaru khaalideena feehaa bi izni Rabbihim tahiyyatuhum feeha salaam ^qTrans1423


But those who shall have attained to faith and done righteous deeds will be brought into gardens through which running waters flow, therein to abide by their Sustainer's leave, and will be welcomed with the greeting, "Peace!" ^qAsad1423


And those who believed and did good works are made to enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein abiding by permission of their Lord, their greeting therein: Peace! ^qPickthall1423


but as for those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, they shall be admitted to gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling forever, by the leave of their Lord, their greeting therein: 'Peace!' ^qArberry1423

Alam tara kaifa darabal laahu masalan kalimatan taiyibatan kashajaratin taiyibatin asluhaa saabitunw wa far'uhaa fis samaaa' ^qTrans1424


ART THOU NOT aware how God sets forth the parable of a good word? [It is] like a good tree, firmly rooted, [reaching out] with its branches towards the sky, ^qAsad1424


Seest thou not how Allah coineth a similitude: A goodly saying, as a goodly tree, its root set firm, its branches reaching into heaven, ^qPickthall1424


Hast thou not seen how God has struck a similitude? A good word is as a good tree -- its roots are firm, and its branches are in heaven; ^qArberry1424

# 25

Tu'teee ukulahaa kulla heenim bi izni Rabbihaa; wa yadribul laahul amsaala linnaasi la'allahum yatazak karoon ^qTrans1425


yielding its fruit at all times by its Sustainer's leave. And [thus it is that] God propounds parables unto men,' so that they might bethink themselves [of the truth]. ^qAsad1425


Giving its fruit at every season by permission of its Lord? Allah coineth the similitudes for mankind in order that they may reflect. ^qPickthall1425


it gives its produce every season by the leave of its Lord. So God strikes similitudes for men; haply they will remember. ^qArberry1425

# 26

Wa masalu kalimatin khabeesatin kashajaratin khabee satinij tussat min fawqil ardi maa lahaa min qaraar ^qTrans1426


And the parable of a corrupt word is that of a corrupt tree, torn up [from its roots] onto the face of the earth, wholly unable to endure. ^qAsad1426


And the similitude of a bad saying is as a bad tree, uprooted from upon the earth, possessing no stability. ^qPickthall1426


And the likeness of a corrupt word is as a corrupt tree -- uprooted from the earth, having no stablishment. ^qArberry1426

# 27

Yusabbitul laahul lazeena aamanoo bilqawlis saabiti fil hayaatid dunyaa wa fil Aakhirati wa yudillul laahuz zaalimeen; wa yaf'alul laahu maa yashaaa' ^qTrans1427


[Thus,] God grants firmness unto those who have attained to faith through the word that is unshakably true in the life of this world as well as in the life to come; but the wrongdoers He lets go astray: for God does whatever He wills. ^qAsad1427


Allah confirmeth those who believe by a firm saying in the life of the world and in the Hereafter, and Allah sendeth wrong-doers astray. And Allah doeth what He will. ^qPickthall1427


God confirms those who believe with the firm word, in the present life and in the world to come; and God leads astray the evildoers; and God does what He will. ^qArberry1427

# 28

Alam tara ilal lazeena baddaloo ni'matal laahi kufranw wa ahalloo qawmahum daaral bawaar ^qTrans1428


ART THOU NOT aware of those who have preferred a denial of the truth to God's blessings, and [thereby] invited their people to alight in that abode of utter desolation ^qAsad1428


Hast thou not seen those who gave the grace of Allah in exchange for thanklessness and led their people down to the Abode of Loss, ^qPickthall1428


Hast thou not seen those who exchanged the bounty of God with unthankfulness, and caused their people to dwell in the abode of ruin? -- ^qArberry1428

# 29

Jahannama yaslawnahaa wa bi'sal qaraar ^qTrans1429


- hell - which they [themselves] will ' have to endure? And how vile a state to settle in! ^qAsad1429


(Even to) hell? They are exposed thereto. A hapless end! ^qPickthall1429


Gehenna, wherein they are roasted; an evil stablishment! ^qArberry1429

# 30

Wa ja'aloo lillaahi andaadal liyudilloo 'an sabeelih; qul tamatta'oo fa innaa maseerakum ilan Naar ^qTrans1430


For, they claimed that there are powers that could rival God, and so they strayed from His path. Say: "Enjoy yourselves [in this world], but, verily, the fire will be your journey's end!" ^qAsad1430


And they set up rivals to Allah that they may mislead (men) from His way. Say: Enjoy life (while ye may) for lo! your journey's end will be the Fire. ^qPickthall1430


And they set up compeers to God, that they might lead astray from His way. Say: 'Take your joy! Your homecoming shall be -- the Fire!' ^qArberry1430

[And] tell [those of] My servants who have attained to faith that they should be constant in prayer and spend [in Our way], secretly and openly, out of what We provide for them as sustenance, ere there come a Day when there will be no bargaining, and no mutual befriending. ^qAsad1431


Tell My bondmen who believe to establish worship and spend of that which We have given them, secretly and publicly, before a day cometh wherein there will be neither traffick nor befriending. ^qPickthall1431
