# 32

Fa aghwainaakum innaa kunnaa ghaaween ^qTrans3631


So then, [if it be true that] we have caused you to err grievously - behold, we ourselves had been lost in grievous error!” ^qAsad3631


Thus we misled you. Lo! we were (ourselves) astray. ^qPickthall3631


Therefore we perverted you, and we ourselves were perverts.' ^qArberry3631

# 33

Fa innahum Yawma'izin fil'azaabi mushtarikoon ^qTrans3632


And, verily, on that Day they all will share in their common suffering. ^qAsad3632


Then lo! this day they (both) are sharers in the doom. ^qPickthall3632

# 35

Innahum kaanooo izaa qeela lahum laaa ilaaha illal laahu yastakbiroon ^qTrans3634


for, behold, whenever they were told, “There is no deity save God,” they would glory in their arrogance ^qAsad3634


For when it was said unto them, There is no Allah save Allah, they were scornful ^qPickthall3634


for when it was said to them, 'There is no god but God,' they were ever waxing proud, ^qArberry3634

# 36

Wa yaqooloona a'innaa lataarikooo aalihatinaa lishaa'irim majnoon ^qTrans3635


and would say, “Shall we, then, give up our deities at the bidding of a mad poet?” ^qAsad3635


And said: Shall we forsake our gods for a mad poet? ^qPickthall3635


saying, 'What, shall we forsake our gods for a poet possessed?' ^qArberry3635

# 37

bal jaaa'a bilhaqqi wa saddaqal mursaleen ^qTrans3636


Nay, but he [whom you call a mad poet] has brought the truth; and he confirms the truth of [what the earlier of God’s] message-bearers [have taught]. ^qAsad3636


Nay, but he brought the Truth, and he confirmed those sent (before him). ^qPickthall3636

Behold, you will indeed taste grievous suffering [in the life to come], ^qAsad3637


Lo! (now) verily ye taste the painful doom - ^qPickthall3637


Now certainly you shall be tasting the painful chastisement, ^qArberry3637

# 39

Wa maa tujzawna illaa maa kuntum ta'maloon ^qTrans3638


although you shall not be requited for aught but what you were wont to do. ^qAsad3638


Ye are requited naught save what ye did - ^qPickthall3638


and not be recompensed, except according to what you were doing.' ^qArberry3638

[in the hereafter,] theirs shall be a sustenance which they will recognize ^qAsad3640

for them awaits a known provision, ^qArberry3640

as the fruits [of their life on earth]; and honoured shall they be ^qAsad3641
