Wa maa kaana lanaa 'alaikum min sultaanim bal kuntum qawman taagheen ^qTrans3730


Moreover, we had no power at all over you: nay, you were people filled with overweening arrogance! ^qAsad3730


We had no power over you, but ye were wayward folk. ^qPickthall3730


we had no authority over you; no, you were an insolent people. ^qArberry3730

Now the Word of our Lord hath been fulfilled concerning us. Lo! we are about to taste (the doom). ^qPickthall3731


So our Lord's Word is realised against us; we are tasting it. ^qArberry3731

# 32

Fa aghwainaakum innaa kunnaa ghaaween ^qTrans3732


So then, [if it be true that] we have caused you to err grievously - behold, we ourselves had been lost in grievous error!” ^qAsad3732


Thus we misled you. Lo! we were (ourselves) astray. ^qPickthall3732


Therefore we perverted you, and we ourselves were perverts.' ^qArberry3732

# 33

Fa innahum Yawma'izin fil'azaabi mushtarikoon ^qTrans3733


And, verily, on that Day they all will share in their common suffering. ^qAsad3733


Then lo! this day they (both) are sharers in the doom. ^qPickthall3733


So all of them on that day are sharers in the chastisement. ^qArberry3733

# 35

Innahum kaanooo izaa qeela lahum laaa ilaaha illal laahu yastakbiroon ^qTrans3735


for, behold, whenever they were told, “There is no deity save God,” they would glory in their arrogance ^qAsad3735


For when it was said unto them, There is no Allah save Allah, they were scornful ^qPickthall3735


for when it was said to them, 'There is no god but God,' they were ever waxing proud, ^qArberry3735

# 36

Wa yaqooloona a'innaa lataarikooo aalihatinaa lishaa'irim majnoon ^qTrans3736


and would say, “Shall we, then, give up our deities at the bidding of a mad poet?” ^qAsad3736


And said: Shall we forsake our gods for a mad poet? ^qPickthall3736


saying, 'What, shall we forsake our gods for a poet possessed?' ^qArberry3736

# 37

bal jaaa'a bilhaqqi wa saddaqal mursaleen ^qTrans3737


Nay, but he [whom you call a mad poet] has brought the truth; and he confirms the truth of [what the earlier of God’s] message-bearers [have taught]. ^qAsad3737


Nay, but he brought the Truth, and he confirmed those sent (before him). ^qPickthall3737

Behold, you will indeed taste grievous suffering [in the life to come], ^qAsad3738


Lo! (now) verily ye taste the painful doom - ^qPickthall3738


Now certainly you shall be tasting the painful chastisement, ^qArberry3738

# 39

Wa maa tujzawna illaa maa kuntum ta'maloon ^qTrans3739


although you shall not be requited for aught but what you were wont to do. ^qAsad3739


Ye are requited naught save what ye did - ^qPickthall3739


and not be recompensed, except according to what you were doing.' ^qArberry3739

for them awaits a known provision, ^qArberry3741
