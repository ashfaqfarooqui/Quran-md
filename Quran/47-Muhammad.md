Allazeena kafaroo wa saddoo'an sabeelil laahi adalla a'maalahum ^qTrans460


AS FOR THOSE who are bent on denying the truth and on barring [others] from the path of God - all their [good] deeds will He let go to waste; ^qAsad460


Those who disbelieve and turn (men) from the way of Allah, He rendereth their actions vain. ^qPickthall460


Those who disbelieve and bar from God's way, God will send their works astray. ^qArberry460

Wallazeena aamanoo wa 'amilus saalihaati wa aamanoo bimaa nuzzila 'alaa Muhammadinw-wa huwal haqqu mir Rabbihim kaffara 'anhum saiyiaatihim wa aslaha baalahum ^qTrans461


whereas those who have attained to faith and do righteous deeds, and have come to believe in what has been bestowed from on high on Muhammad - for it is the truth from their Sustainer - [shall attain to God’s grace:] He will efface their [past] bad deeds, and will set their hearts at rest. ^qAsad461


And those who believe and do good works and believe in that which is revealed unto Muhammad - and it is the truth from their Lord - He riddeth them of their ill-deeds and improveth their state. ^qPickthall461


But those who believe and do righteous deeds and believe in what is sent down to Muhammad -- and it is the truth from their Lord -- He will acquit them of their evil deeds, and dispose their minds aright. ^qArberry461

# 3

Zaalika bi annal lazeena kafarut taba'ul baatila wa annal lazeena aamanut taba'ul haqqa mir Rabbihim; kazaalika yadribul laahu linnaasi amsaalahum ^qTrans462


This, because they who are bent on denying the truth pursue falsehood, whereas they who have attained to faith pursue [but] the truth [that flows] from their Sustainer. In this way does God set forth unto man the parables of their true state. ^qAsad462


That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood and because those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus Allah coineth their similitudes for mankind. ^qPickthall462


That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, and those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Even so God strikes their similitudes for men. ^qArberry462

Fa-izaa laqeetumul lazeena kafaroo fadarbar riqaab, hattaaa izaa askhan tumoohum fashuddul wasaaq, fa immaa mannnam ba'du wa immaa fidaaa'an hattaa tada'al harbu awzaarahaa; zaalika wa law yashaaa'ul laahu lantasara minhum wa laakil laiyabluwa ba'dakum biba'd; wallazeena qutiloo fee sabeelil laahi falany yudilla a'maalahum ^qTrans463


NOW WHEN you meet [in war] those who are bent on denying the truth, smite their necks until you overcome them fully, and then tighten their bonds; but thereafter [set them free,] either by an act of grace or against ransom, so that the burden of war may be lifted: thus [shall it be]. And [know that] had God so willed, He could indeed punish them [Himself]; but [He wills you to struggle] so as to test you [all] by means of one another. And as for those who are slain in God’s cause, never will He let their deeds go to waste: ^qAsad463


Now when ye meet in battle those who disbelieve, then it is smiting of the necks until, when ye have routed them, then making fast of bonds; and afterward either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens. That (is the ordinance). And if Allah willed He could have punished them (without you) but (thus it is ordained) that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who are slain in the way of Allah, He rendereth not their actions vain. ^qPickthall463


When you meet the unbelievers, smite their necks, then, when you have made wide slaughter among them, tie fast the bonds; then set them free, either by grace or ransom, till the war lays down its loads. So it shall be; and if God had willed, He would have avenged Himself upon them; but that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who are slain in the way of God, He will not send their works astray. ^qArberry463

# 5

Sa-yahdeehim wa yusihu baalahum ^qTrans464


He will guide them [in the hereafter as well], and will set their hearts at rest, ^qAsad464


He will guide them and improve their state, ^qPickthall464


He will guide them, and dispose their minds aright, ^qArberry464

# 6

Wa yudkhiluhumul jannata 'arrafahaa lahum ^qTrans465


and will admit them to the paradise which He has promised them. ^qAsad465


And bring them in unto the Garden which He hath made known to them. ^qPickthall465


and He will admit them to Paradise, that He has made known to them. ^qArberry465

# 7

Yaaa ayyuhal lazeena aamanooo in tansurul laaha yansurkum wa yusabbit aqdaamakum ^qTrans466


O you who have attained to faith! If you help [the cause of] God, He will help you, and will make firm your steps; ^qAsad466


O ye who believe! If ye help Allah, He will help you and will make your foothold firm. ^qPickthall466


O believers, if you help God, He will help you, and confirm your feet. ^qArberry466

# 8

Wallazeena kafaroo fata's al lahum wa adalla a'maalahum ^qTrans467


but as for those who are bent on denying the truth, ill fortune awaits them, since He will let all their [good] deeds go to waste: ^qAsad467


And those who disbelieve, perdition is for them, and He will make their actions vain. ^qPickthall467


But as for the unbelievers, ill chance shall befall them! He will send their works astray. ^qArberry467

# 9

Zaalika bi annahum karihoo maaa anzalal laahu faahbata a'maalahum ^qTrans468


this, because they hate [the very thought of] what God has bestowed from on high and thus He causes all their deeds to come to nought! ^qAsad468


That is because they are averse to that which Allah hath revealed, therefor maketh He their actions fruitless. ^qPickthall468


That is because they have been averse to what God has sent down, so He has made their works to fail. ^qArberry468

# 10

Afalam yaseeroo fil ardi fayanzuroo kaifa kaana 'aaqibatul lazeena min qablihim; dammaral laahu 'alaihim wa lilkaafireena amsaaluhaa ^qTrans469


Have they, then, never journeyed about the earth and beheld what happened in the end to those [willful sinners] who lived before their time? God destroyed them utterly: and the like thereof awaits all who deny the truth. ^qAsad469


Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those who were before them? Allah wiped them out. And for the disbelievers there will be the like thereof. ^qPickthall469


What, have they not journeyed in the land and beheld how was the end of those before them? God destroyed them; the unbelievers shall have the likes thereof. ^qArberry469

# 11

Zaalika bi annal laaha mawlal lazeena aamanoo wa annal kaafireena laa mawlaa lahum ^qTrans4610


This, because God is the Protector of all who have attained to faith, whereas they who deny the truth have no protector. ^qAsad4610


That is because Allah is patron of those who believe, and because the disbelievers have no patron. ^qPickthall4610


That is because God is the Protector of the believers, and that the unbelievers have no protector. ^qArberry4610

# 12

Innal-laaha yudkhilul lazeena aamanoo wa 'amilus saalihaati Jannaatin tajree min tahtihal anhaaru wallazeena kafaroo yatamatta'oona wa yaakuloona kamaa taakuluian'aamu wan Naaru maswallahum ^qTrans4611


Verily, God will admit all who attain to faith and do righteous deeds into gardens through which running waters flow, whereas they who are bent on denying the truth shall have - even though they may enjoy their life [in this world] and eat as cattle eat - the fire [of the hereafter] for their abode. ^qAsad4611


Lo! Allah will cause those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow; while those who disbelieve take their comfort in this life and eat even as the cattle eat, and the Fire is their habitation. ^qPickthall4611


God shall surely admit those who believe and do righteous deeds into gardens underneath which rivers flow. As for the unbelievers, they take their enjoyment and eat as cattle eat; and the Fire shall be their lodging. ^qArberry4611

# 13

Wa ka ayyim min qaryatin hiya ashaddu quwwatam min qaryatikal lateee akhrajatka ahlaknaahum falaa naasira lahum ^qTrans4612


And how many a community of greater power than this thy community which has driven thee out, [O Muhammad,] have We destroyed, with none to succour them! ^qAsad4612


And how many a township stronger than thy township (O Muhammad) which hath cast thee out, have We destroyed, and they had no helper! ^qPickthall4612


How many a city that was stronger in might than thy city which has expelled thee have We destroyed! And there was no helper for them. ^qArberry4612

# 14

Afaman kaana 'alaa baiyinatim mir Rabbihee kaman zuyyina lahoo sooo'u 'amalihee wattaba'ooo ahwaaa'ahum ^qTrans4613


CAN, THEN, he who takes his stand on a clear evidence from his Sustainer be likened Unto one to whom the evil of his own doings [always] seems goodly, and unto such as would follow but their own lusts? ^qAsad4613


Is he who relieth on a clear proof from his Lord like those for whom the evil that they do is beautified while they follow their own lusts? ^qPickthall4613


What, is he who is upon a clear sign from his Lord like unto such a one unto whom his evil deeds have been decked out fair, and they have followed their caprices? ^qArberry4613

# 15

Masalul jannatil latee wu'idal muttaqoona feehaaa anhaarum mim maaa'in ghayri aasininw wa anhaarum mil labanil lam yataghaiyar ta'muhoo wa anhaarum min khamril lazzatil lishshaaribeena wa anhaarum min 'asalim musaffanw wa lahum feeha min kullis samaraati wa maghfiratum mir Rabbihim kaman huwa khaalidun fin naari wa suqoo maaa'an hameeman faqatta'a am'aaa'ahum ^qTrans4614


[And can] the parable of the paradise which the God-conscious are promised [a paradise] wherein there are rivers of water which time does not corrupt, and rivers of milk the taste whereof never alters, and rivers of wine delightful to those who drink it, and rivers of honey of all impurity cleansed, and the enjoyment of all the fruits [of their good deeds] and of forgiveness from their Sustainer -: can this [parable of paradise] be likened unto [the parable of the recompense of] such as are to abide in the fire and be given waters of burning despair to drink, so that it will tear their bowels asunder? ^qAsad4614


A similitude of the Garden which those who keep their duty (to Allah) are promised: Therein are rivers of water unpolluted, and rivers of milk whereof the flavour changeth not, and rivers of wine delicious to the drinkers, and rivers of clear-run honey; therein for them is every kind of fruit, with pardon from their Lord. (Are those who enjoy all this) like those who are immortal in the Fire and are given boiling water to drink so that it teareth their bowels? ^qPickthall4614


This is the similitude of Paradise which the godfearing have been promised: therein are rivers of water unstaling, rivers of milk unchanging in flavour, and rivers of wine -- a delight to the drinkers, rivers, too, of honey purified; and therein for them is every fruit, and forgiveness from their Lord -- Are they as he who dwells forever in the Fire, such as are given to drink boiling water, that tears their bowels asunder? ^qArberry4614

Wa minhum mai yastami' ilaika hattaaa izaa kharajoo min 'indika qaaloo lillazeena ootul 'ilma maazaa qaala aanifaa; ulaaa'ikal lazeena taba'al laahu 'alaa quloobihim wattaba'ooo ahwaaa'ahum ^qTrans4615


Now among those [hapless sinners] are such as [pretend to] listen to thee, [O Muhammad,] and then, as soon as they leave thy presence, speak [with scorn] unto those who have understood [thy mes­sage]: “What is it that he has said just now?” It is such as these whose hearts God has sealed because they [always] followed but their own lusts ^qAsad4615


Among them are some who give ear unto thee (Muhammad) till, when they go forth from thy presence they say unto those who have been given knowledge: What was that he said just now? Those are they whose hearts Allah hath sealed, and they follow their own lusts. ^qPickthall4615


And some of them there are give ear to thee, till, when they go forth from thee, they say to those who have been given knowledge, 'What said he just now?' Those are they upon whose hearts God has set a seal, and they have followed their caprices. ^qArberry4615

# 17

Wallazeenah tadaw zaadahum hudanw wa aataahum taqwaahum ^qTrans4616


just as for those who are [willing to be] guided, He increases their [ability to follow His] guidance and causes them to grow in God-consciousness. ^qAsad4616


While as for those who walk aright, He addeth to their guidance, and giveth them their protection (against evil). ^qPickthall4616


But those who are guided aright, them He increases in guidance, and gives them their godfearing. ^qArberry4616

# 18

Fahal yanzuroona illas Saa'ata an taatiyahum baghtatan faqad jaaa'a ashraatuhaa; fa-annnaa lahum izaa jaaa'at hum zikraahum ^qTrans4617


Are, then, they [whose hearts are sealed] wait­ing for the Last Hour - [waiting] that it come upon them of a sudden? But it has already been foretold! And what will their remembrance [of their past sins] avail them, once it has come upon them? ^qAsad4617


Await they aught save the Hour, that it should come upon them unawares? And the beginnings thereof have already come. But how, when it hath come upon them, can they take their warning? ^qPickthall4617


Are they looking for aught but the Hour, that it shall come upon them suddenly? Already its tokens have come; so, when it has come to them, how shall they have their Reminder? ^qArberry4617

# 19

Fa'lam annahoo laaa ilaaha illal laahu wastaghfir lizambika wa lilmu'mineena walmu'minaat; wallaahu ya'lamu mutaqallabakum wa maswaakum ^qTrans4618


Know, then, [O man,] that there is no deity save God, and [while there is yet time,] ask forgive­ness for thy sins and for [the sins of] all other believing men and women: for God knows all your comings and goings as well as your abiding [at rest]. ^qAsad4618


So know (O Muhammad) that there is no Allah save Allah, and ask forgiveness for thy sin and for believing men and believing women. Allah knoweth (both) your place of turmoil and your place of rest. ^qPickthall4618


Know thou therefore that there is no god but God, and ask forgiveness for thy sin, and for the believers, men and women. God knows your going to and fro, and your lodging. ^qArberry4618

Wa yaqoolul lazeena aamanoo law laa nuzzilat Sooratun fa izaaa unzilat Sooratum Muhkamatunw wa zukira feehal qitaalu ra aytal lazeena fee quloobihim maraduny yanzuroona ilaika nazaral maghshiyyi 'alaihi minal mawti fa'awlaa lahum ^qTrans4619


NOW THOSE who have attained to faith say, “Would that a revelation [allowing us to fight] was bestowed from on high!” But now that a revelation clear in and by itself, mentioning war, has been bestowed from on high, thou canst see those in whose hearts is disease look­ing at thee, [O Muhammad,] with the look of one who is about to faint for fear of death! And yet, far better for them would be ^qAsad4619


And those who believe say: If only a surah were revealed! But when a decisive surah is revealed and war is mentioned therein, thou seest those in whose hearts is a disease looking at thee with the look of men fainting unto death. Therefor woe unto them! ^qPickthall4619


Those who believe say, 'Why has a sura not been sent down?' Then, when a clear sura is sent down, and therein fighting is mentioned, thou seest those in whose hearts is sickness looking at thee as one who swoons of death; but better for them would be ^qArberry4619

# 21

Taa'atunw wa qawlum ma'roof; fa izaa 'azamal amru falaw sadaqul laaha lakaana khairal lahum ^qTrans4620


obedience [to God’s call] and a word that could win [His] approval: for, since the matter has been resolved [by His revelation], it would be but for their own good to remain true to God. ^qAsad4620


Obedience and a civil word. Then, when the matter is determined, if they are loyal to Allah it will be well for them. ^qPickthall4620


obedience, and words honourable. Then, when the matter is resolved, if they were true to God, it would be better for them. ^qArberry4620

# 22

Fahal 'asaitum in tawallaitum an tufsidoo fil ardi wa tuqatti'ooo arhaamakum ^qTrans4621


[Ask them:] “Would you, perchance, after having turned away [from God’s commandment, pre­fer to revert to your old ways, and] spread corruption on earth, and [once again] cut asunder your ties of kinship?” ^qAsad4621


Would ye then, if ye were given the command, work corruption in the land and sever your ties of kinship? ^qPickthall4621


If you turned away, would you then haply work corruption in the land, and break your bonds of kin? ^qArberry4621

# 23

Ulaaa'ikal lazeena la'anahumul laahu fa asammahum wa a'maaa absaarahum ^qTrans4622


It is such as these whom God rejects, and whom He makes deaf [to the voice of truth], and whose eyes He blinds [to its sight]! ^qAsad4622


Such are they whom Allah curseth so that He deafeneth them and maketh blind their eyes. ^qPickthall4622


Those are they whom God has cursed, and so made them deaf, and blinded their eyes. ^qArberry4622

# 24

Afalaa yatadabbaroonal Qur-aana am 'alaa quloobin aqfaaluhaa ^qTrans4623


Will they not, then, ponder over this Qur’an? - or are there locks upon their hearts? ^qAsad4623


Will they then not meditate on the Qur'an, or are there locks on the hearts? ^qPickthall4623


What, do they not ponder the Koran? Or is it that there are locks upon their hearts? ^qArberry4623

# 25

Innal lazeenar taddoo 'alaaa adbaarihim mim ba'di maa tabaiyana lahumul hudash Shaitaanu sawwala lahum wa amlaa lahum ^qTrans4624


VERILY, those who turn their backs [on this mes­sage] after guidance has been vouchsafed to them, [do it because] Satan has embellished their fancies and filled them with false hopes: ^qAsad4624


Lo! those who turn back after the guidance hath been manifested unto them, Satan hath seduced them, and He giveth them the rein. ^qPickthall4624


Those who have turned back in their traces after the guidance has become clear to them, Satan it was that tempted them, and God respited them. ^qArberry4624

# 26

Zaalika bi annahum qaaloo lillazeena karihoo maa nazzalal laahu sanutee'ukum fee ba'dil amri wallaahu ya'lamu israarahum ^qTrans4625


[they do turn their backs on it] inasmuch as they are wont to say unto those who abhor all that God has revealed, “We will comply with your views on some points.” But God knows their secret thoughts: ^qAsad4625


That is because they say unto those who hate what Allah hath revealed: We will obey you in some matters; and Allah knoweth their secret talk. ^qPickthall4625


That is because they said to those who were averse to what God sent down, 'We will obey you in some of the affair'; and God knows their secrets. ^qArberry4625

# 27

Fakaifa izaa tawaffat humul malaaa'ikatu yadriboona wujoohahum wa adbaa rahum ^qTrans4626


hence, how [will they fare] when the angels gather them in death, striking their faces and their backs? ^qAsad4626


Then how (will it be with them) when the angels gather them, smiting their faces and their backs! ^qPickthall4626


How shall it be, when the angels take them, beating their faces and their backs? ^qArberry4626

# 28

Zaalika bi annahumut taba'oo maaa askhatal laaha wa karihoo ridwaanahoo fa ahbata a'maalahum ^qTrans4627


This, because they were wont to pursue what God con­demns and to hate [whatever would meet with] His goodly acceptance: and so He has caused all their [good] deeds to come to nought. ^qAsad4627


That will be because they followed that which angereth Allah, and hated that which pleaseth Him. Therefor He hath made their actions vain. ^qPickthall4627


That is because they have followed what angers God, and have been averse to His good pleasure, so He has made their works to fail. ^qArberry4627

# 29

Am hasibal lazeena fee quloobihim maradun al lan yukhrijal laahu adghaanahum ^qTrans4628


Or do they in whose hearts is disease think, perchance, that God would never bring their moral failings to light? ^qAsad4628


Or do those in whose hearts is a disease deem that Allah will not bring to light their (secret) hates? ^qPickthall4628


Or did those in whose hearts is sickness think that God would not bring to light their rancour? ^qArberry4628

# 30

Wa law nashaaa'u la-arainaakahum fala 'araftahum bi seemaahum; wa lata'rifan nahum fee lahnil qawl; wallaahu ya'lamu a'maalakum ^qTrans4629


Now had We so willed, We could have shown them clearly to thee, so that thou wouldst know them for sure as by a visible mark: but [even so,] thou wilt most certainly recognize them by the tone of their voice. And God knows all that you do, [O men;] ^qAsad4629


And if We would, We could show them unto thee (Muhammad) so that thou shouldst know them surely by their marks. And thou shalt know them by the burden of their talk. And Allah knoweth your deeds. ^qPickthall4629


Did We will, We would show them to thee, then thou wouldst know them by their mark; and thou shalt certainly know them in the twisting of their speech; and God knows your deeds. ^qArberry4629

# 31

Wa lanabluwannakum hattaa na'lamal mujaahideena minkum wassaabireena wa nabluwa akhbaarakum ^qTrans4630


and most certainly We shall try you all, so that We might mark out those of you who strive hard [in Our cause] and are patient in adversity: for We shall put to a test [the truth of] all your assertions. ^qAsad4630


And verily We shall try you till We know those of you who strive hard (for the cause of Allah) and the steadfast, and till We test your record. ^qPickthall4630


And We shall assuredly try you until We know those of you who struggle and are steadfast, and try your tidings. ^qArberry4630

Verily, they who are bent on denying the truth and on barring [others] from the path of God, and [who thus] cut themselves off from the Apostle after guidance has been vouchsafed to them, can in no wise harm God; but He will cause all their deeds to come to nought. ^qAsad4631


Lo! those who disbelieve and turn from the way of Allah and oppose the messenger after the guidance hath been manifested unto them, they hurt Allah not a jot, and He will make their actions fruitless. ^qPickthall4631


Those who disbelieve and bar from God's way and make a breach with the Messenger after the guidance has become clear to them, they will nothing hurt God, and He will make their works to fail. ^qArberry4631

# 33

Yaaa ayyuhal lazeena aamanoo atee'ul laaha wa atee'ur Rasoola wa laa tubtilooo a'maalakum ^qTrans4632


O you who have attained to faith! Pay heed unto God, and pay heed unto the Apostle, and let not your [good] deeds come to nought! ^qAsad4632


O ye who believe! Obey Allah and obey the messenger, and render not your actions vain. ^qPickthall4632


O believers, obey God, and obey the Messenger, and do not make your own works vain. ^qArberry4632

# 34

Innal lazeena kafaroo wa saddoo 'an sabeelil laahi summa maatoo wa hum kuffaarun falany yaghfirallaahu lahum ^qTrans4633


Verily, as for those who are bent on denying the truth and on barring [others] from the path of God, and then die as deniers of the truth - indeed, God will not grant them forgiveness! ^qAsad4633


Lo! those who disbelieve and turn from the way of Allah and then die disbelievers, Allah surely will not pardon them. ^qPickthall4633


Those who disbelieve and bar from God's way and then die disbelieving, them God will not forgive. ^qArberry4633

# 35

Falaa tahinoo wa tad'ooo ilas salmi wa antumul a'lawna wallaahu ma'akum wa lany yatirakum a'maalakum ^qTrans4634


AND SO, [when you fight in a just cause,] do not lose heart and [never] beg for peace: for, seeing that God is with you, you are bound to rise high [in the end]; and never will He let your [good] deeds go to waste. ^qAsad4634


So do not falter and cry out for peace when ye (will be) the uppermost, and Allah is with you, and He will not grudge (the reward of) your actions. ^qPickthall4634


So do not faint and call for peace; you shall be the upper ones, and God is with you, and will not deprive you of your works. ^qArberry4634

# 36

Innamal hayaatud dunyaa la'ibunw wa lahw; wa in to'minoo wa tattaqoo yu'tikum ujoorakum wa laa yas'alkum amwaalakum ^qTrans4635


The life of this world is but a play and a passing delight: but if you believe [in God] and are conscious of Him, He will grant you your deserts. And withal, He does not demand of you [to sacrifice in His cause all of] your possessions: ^qAsad4635


The life of the world is but a sport and a pastime. And if ye believe and ward off (evil). He will give you your wages, and will not ask of you your wordly wealth. ^qPickthall4635


The present life is naught but a sport and a diversion; and if you believe and are godfearing, He will give you your wages, and will not ask of you your goods. ^qArberry4635

[for,] if He were to demand of you all of them, and urge you, you would niggardly cling [to them], and so He would [but] bring out your moral failings. ^qAsad4636


If He should ask it of you and importune you, ye would hoard it, and He would bring to light your (secret) hates. ^qPickthall4636


If He asks you for them, and presses you, you are niggardly, and He brings to light your rancour. ^qArberry4636

haaa antum haaa'ulaaa'i tud'awna litunfiqoo fee sabeelillaahi faminkum many yabkhalu wa many yabkhal fa innamaa yabkhalu 'an nafsih; wallaahu Ghaniyyu wa antumul fuqaraaa'; wa in tatwal law yastabdil qawman ghairakum summa laa yakoonooo amsaalakum ^qTrans4637


Behold, [O believers,] it is you who are called upon to spend freely in God’s cause: but [even] among you are such as turn out to be niggardly! And yet, he who acts niggardly [in God’s cause] is but niggardly towards his own self: for God is indeed self-sufficient, whereas you stand in need [of Him]; and if you turn away [from Him], He will cause other people to take your place, and they will not be the likes of you! ^qAsad4637


Lo! ye are those who are called to spend in the way of Allah, yet among you there are some who hoard. And as for him who hoardeth, he hoardeth only from his soul. And Allah is the Rich, and ye are the poor. And if ye turn away He will exchange you for some other folk, and they will not be the likes of you. ^qPickthall4637


Ha, there you are; you are called upon to expend in God's way, and some of you are niggardly. Whoso is niggardly is niggardly only to his own soul. God is the All-sufficient; you are the needy ones. If you turn away, He will substitute another people instead of you, then they will not be your likes. ^qArberry4637
