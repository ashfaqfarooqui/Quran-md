Iqtaraba linnaasi hisaa buhum wa hum fee ghaflatim mu'ridoon ^qTrans200


CLOSER DRAWS unto men their reckoning: and yet they remain stubbornly heedless [of its approach]. ^qAsad200


Their reckoning draweth nigh for mankind, while they turn away in heedlessness. ^qPickthall200


Nigh unto men has drawn their reckoning, while they in heedlessness are yet turning away; ^qArberry200

Maa yaateehim min zikrim mir Rabbihim muhdasin illas tama'oohu wa hum yal'aboon ^qTrans201


Whenever there comes unto them any new re­minder from their Sustainer, they but listen to it with playful amusement, ^qAsad201


Never cometh there unto them a new reminder from their Lord but they listen to it while they play, ^qPickthall201


no Remembrance from their Lord comes to them lately renewed, but they listen to it yet playing, ^qArberry201

# 3

Laahiyatan quloobuhum; wa asarrun najwal lazeena zalamoo hal haazaa illaa basharum mislukum afataa toonas sihra wa antum tubsiroon ^qTrans202


their hearts set on passing ­delights; yet they who are [thus] bent on wrongdoing conceal their innermost thoughts [when they say to one another], “Is this [Muhammad] anything but a mortal like yourselves? Will you, then, yield to [his] spellbinding eloquence with your eyes open?” ^qAsad202


With hearts preoccupied. And they confer in secret. The wrong-doers say: Is this other than a mortal like you? Will ye then succumb to magic when ye see (it)? ^qPickthall202


diverted their hearts. The evildoers whisper one to another, 'Is this aught but a mortal like to yourselves? What, will you take to sorcery with your eyes open?' ^qArberry202

# 4

Qaala Rabbee ya'lamul qawla fis samaaa'i wal ardi wa Huwas Samee'ul Aleem ^qTrans203


Say: “My Sustainer knows whatever is spoken in heaven and on earth; and He alone is all-hearing, all-knowing.” ^qAsad203


He saith: My Lord knoweth what is spoken in the heaven and the earth. He is the Hearer, the Knower. ^qPickthall203


He says: 'My Lord knows what is said in the heavens and the earth, and He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.' ^qArberry203

# 5

Bal qaalooo adghaasu ahlaamim balif taraahu bal huwa shaa'irun falyaatinaa bi Aayatin kamaa ursilal awwaloon ^qTrans204


“Nay,” they say, “[Muhammad propounds] the most involved and confusing of dreams!” “Nay, but he has invented [all] this!” - “Nay, but he is [only] a poet!” - [and,] “Let him, then, come unto us with a miracle, just as those [prophets] of old were sent [with miracles]?” ^qAsad204


Nay, say they, (these are but) muddled dreams; nay, he hath but invented it; nay, he is but a poet. Let him bring us a portent even as those of old (who were Allah's messengers) were sent (with portents). ^qPickthall204


Nay, but they say: 'A hotchpotch of nightmares! Nay, he has forged it; nay, he is a poet! Now therefore let him bring us a sign, even as the ancient ones were sent as Messengers.' ^qArberry204

# 6

Maaa aaamanat qablahum min qaryatin ahlaknaahaa a-fahum yu'minoon ^qTrans205


Not one of the communities that We destroyed in bygone times would ever believe [their prophets]: will these, then, [be more willing to] believe? ^qAsad205


Not a township believed of those which We destroyed before them (though We sent them portents): would they then believe? ^qPickthall205


Not one city that We destroyed before them believed; what then, will they not believe? ^qArberry205

# 7

Wa maaa arsalnaa qablaka illaa rijaalan nooheee ilaihim fas'aloo ahlaz zikri in kuntum laa ta'lamoon ^qTrans206


For [even] before thy time, [O Muhammad,] We never sent [as Our apostles] any but [mortal] men, whom We inspired - hence, [tell the deniers of the truth,] “If you do not know this, ask the followers of earlier revelation” ^qAsad206


And We sent not (as Our messengers) before thee other than men, whom We inspired. Ask the followers of the Reminder if ye know not? ^qPickthall206


And We sent none before thee, but men to whom We made revelation -- question the People of the Remembrance, if you do not know -- ^qArberry206

# 8

Wa maa ja'alnaahum jasadal laa yaakuloonat ta'aama wa maa kaanoo khaalideen ^qTrans207


and neither did We endow them with bodies that could dispense with food nor were they immortal. ^qAsad207


We gave them not bodies that would not eat food, nor were they immortals. ^qPickthall207


nor did We fashion them as bodies that ate not food, neither were they immortal; ^qArberry207

# 9

summa sadaqnaa humul wa'da fa-anjainaahum wa man nashaaa'u wa ahlaknal musrifeen ^qTrans208


In the end, We made good unto them Our promise, and We saved them and all whom We willed [to save], and We destroyed those who had wasted their own selves. ^qAsad208


Then we fulfilled the promise unto them. So we delivered them and whom We would, and We destroyed the prodigals. ^qPickthall208


then We made true the promise We gave them and We delivered them, and whomsoever We would; and We destroyed the prodigal. ^qArberry208

# 10

Laqad anzalnaaa ilaikum Kitaaban feehi zikrukum afalaa ta'qiloon ^qTrans209


[O MEN!] We have now bestowed upon you from on high a divine writ containing all that you ought to bear in mind will you not, then, use your reason? ^qAsad209


Now We have revealed unto you a Scripture wherein is your Reminder. Have ye then no sense? ^qPickthall209


Now We have sent down to you a Book wherein is your Remembrance; will you not understand? ^qArberry209

# 11

Wa kam qasamnaa min qaryatin kannat zaalimatanw wa anshadnaa ba'dahaa qawman aakhareen ^qTrans2010


For, how many a community that persisted in evildoing have We dashed into fragments, and raised another people in its stead! ^qAsad2010


How many a community that dealt unjustly have We shattered, and raised up after them another folk! ^qPickthall2010


How many a city that was evildoing We have shattered, and set up after it another people! ^qArberry2010

# 12

Falammaaa ahassoo baasanaaa izaaa hum minhaa yarkudoon ^qTrans2011


And [every time,] as soon as they began to feel Our punishing might, lo! they tried to flee from it ^qAsad2011


And, when they felt Our might, behold them fleeing from it! ^qPickthall2011


Then, when they perceived Our might, behold, they ran headlong out of it. ^qArberry2011

# 13

Laa tarkudoo warji'ooo ilaa maaa utriftum feehe wa masaakinikum la'allakum tus'aloon ^qTrans2012


[and at the same time they seemed to hear a scornful voice]: “Do not try to flee, but return to all that [once] gave you pleasure and corrupted your whole being. and [return] to your homes, so that you might be called to account [for what you have done]!” ^qAsad2012


(But it was said unto them): Flee not, but return to that (existence) which emasculated you and to your dwellings, that ye may be questioned. ^qPickthall2012


'Run not! Return you unto the luxury that you exulted in, and your dwelling-places; haply you shall be questioned.' ^qArberry2012

# 14

Qaaloo yaa wailanaaa innaa kunnaa zaalimeen ^qTrans2013


And they could only cry: “Oh, woe unto us! Verily, we were wrongdoers!” ^qAsad2013


They cried: Alas for us! we were wrong-doers. ^qPickthall2013


They said, 'Alas for us! We have been evildoers.' ^qArberry2013

# 15

Famaa zaalat tilka da'waahum hattaa ja'alnaahum haseedan khaamideen ^qTrans2014


And that cry of theirs did not cease until We caused them to become [like] a field mown down, still and silent as ashes. ^qAsad2014


And this their crying ceased not till We made them as reaped corn, extinct. ^qPickthall2014


So they ceased not to cry, until We made them stubble, silent and still. ^qArberry2014

# 16

Wa maa khalaqnas samaaa'a wal arda wa maa bainahumaa laa'ibeen ^qTrans2015


AND [know that] We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in mere idle play: ^qAsad2015


We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in play. ^qPickthall2015


We created not the heaven and the earth, and whatsoever between them is, as playing; ^qArberry2015

# 17

Law aradnaaa an nattakhiza lahwal lat takhaznaahu mil ladunnaaa in kunnaa faa'ileen ^qTrans2016


[for,] had We willed to indulge in a pastime, We would indeed have produced it from within Ourselves - if such had been Our will at all! ^qAsad2016


If We had wished to find a pastime, We could have found it in Our presence - if We ever did. ^qPickthall2016


had We desired to take to Us a diversion We would have taken it to Us from Ourselves, had We done aught. ^qArberry2016

# 18

Bal naqzifu bilhaqqi 'alal baatili fa yadmaghuhoo fa izaa huwa zaahiq; wa lakumul wailu mimmaa tasifoon ^qTrans2017


Nay, but [by the very act of creation] We hurl the truth against falsehood, and it crushes the latter: and lo! it withers away. But woe unto you for all your [attempts at] defining [God] – ^qAsad2017


Nay, but We hurl the true against the false, and it doth break its head and lo! it vanisheth. And yours will be woe for that which ye ascribe (unto Him). ^qPickthall2017


Nay, but We hurl the truth against falsehood and it prevails over it, and behold, falsehood vanishes away. Then woe to you for that you describe! ^qArberry2017

# 19

Wa lahoo man fis samaawaati wal ard; wa man 'indahoo laa yastakbiroona 'an 'ibaada tihee wa laa yastahsiroon ^qTrans2018


for, unto Him belong all [beings] that are in the heavens and on earth; and those that are with Him are never too proud to worship Him and never grow weary [thereof]: ^qAsad2018


Unto Him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those who dwell in His presence are not too proud to worship Him, nor do they weary; ^qPickthall2018


To Him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and the earth; and those who are with Him wax not too proud to do Him service neither grow weary, ^qArberry2018

# 20

Yusabbihoona laila wannahaara laa yafturoon ^qTrans2019


they extol His lim­itless glory by night and by day, never flagging [therein]. ^qAsad2019


They glorify (Him) night and day; they flag not. ^qPickthall2019


glorifying Him by night and in the daytime and never failing. ^qArberry2019

# 21

Amit takhazooo aalihatam minal ardi hum yunshiroon ^qTrans2020


And yet some people choose to worship certain earthly things or beings as deities that [are supposed to] resurrect [the dead; and they fail to realize that], ^qAsad2020


Or have they chosen gods from the earth who raise the dead? ^qPickthall2020


Or have they taken gods out of the earth who raise the dead? ^qArberry2020

# 22

Law kaana feehimaaa aalihatun illal laahu lafasadataa; fa-Subhaanal laahi Rabbil 'Arshi 'ammaa yasifoon ^qTrans2021


had there been in heaven or on earth any deities other than God, both [those realms would surely have fallen into ruin! But limitless in His glory is God, enthroned in His awesome almightiness far] above anything that men may devise by way of definition! ^qAsad2021


If there were therein gods beside Allah, then verily both (the heavens and the earth) had been disordered. Glorified be Allah, the Lord of the Throne, from all that they ascribe (unto Him). ^qPickthall2021


Why, were there gods in earth and heaven other than God, they would surely go to ruin; so glory be to God, the Lord of the Throne, above that they describe! ^qArberry2021

# 23

Laa yus'alu 'ammaa yaf'alu wa hum yus'aloon ^qTrans2022


He cannot be called to account for whatever He does, whereas they will be called to account: ^qAsad2022


He will not be questioned as to that which He doeth, but they will be questioned. ^qPickthall2022


He shall not be questioned as to what He does, but they shall he questioned. ^qArberry2022

# 24

Amit takhazoo min doonihee aalihatan qul haatoo burhaanakum haaza zikru mam ma'iya wa zikru man qablee; bal aksaruhum laa ya'lamoonal haqqa fahum mu'ridoon ^qTrans2023


and yet, they choose to worship [imaginary] deities instead of Him! Say [O Prophet]: “Produce an evidence for what you are claiming: this is a reminder [unceasingly voiced] by those who are with me, just as it was a reminder [voiced] by those who came before me.” But nay, most of them do not know the truth, and so they stubbornly turn away [from it] ^qAsad2023


Or have they chosen other gods beside Him? say: Bring your proof (of their godhead). This is the Reminder of those with me and those before me, but most of them know not the Truth and so they are averse. ^qPickthall2023


Or have they taken gods apart from Him? Say: 'Bring your proof! This is the Remembrance of him who is with me, and the Remembrance of those before me. Nay, but the most part of them know not the truth, so therefore they are turning away. ^qArberry2023

# 25

Wa maaa arsalnaa min qablika mir Rasoolin illaa nooheee ilaihi annahoo laaa ilaaha illaaa Ana fa'budoon ^qTrans2024


and [this despite the fact that even] before thy time We never sent any apostle without having revealed to him that there is no deity save Me, - [and that,] therefore, you shall worship Me [alone]! ^qAsad2024


And We sent no messenger before thee but We inspired him, (saying): There is no Allah save Me (Allah), so worship Me. ^qPickthall2024


And We sent never a Messenger before thee except that We revealed to him, saying, 'There is no god but I; so serve Me.' ^qArberry2024

# 26

Wa qaalut takhazar Rahmaanu waladan Subhaanah; bal 'ibaadum mkkramoon ^qTrans2025


And [yet,] some say, “The Most Gracious has taken unto Himself a son”! Limitless is He in His glory! Nay, [those whom they regard as God’s “offspring” are but His] honoured servants: ^qAsad2025


And they say: The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son. Be He Glorified! Nay, but (those whom they call sons) are honoured slaves; ^qPickthall2025


They say:' 'The All-merciful has taken to Him a son.' Glory be to Him! Nay, but they are honoured servants ^qArberry2025

# 27

Laa yasbiqoonahoo bil qawli wa hum bi amrihee ya'maloon ^qTrans2026


they speak not until He has spoken unto them, and [whenever they act,] they act at His behest. ^qAsad2026


They speak not until He hath spoken, and they act by His command. ^qPickthall2026


that outstrip Him not in speech, and perform as He commands. ^qArberry2026

# 28

Ya'lamu maa baina aideehim wa maa khalfahum wa laa yashfa'oona illaa limanir tadaa wa hum min khash yatihee mushfiqoon ^qTrans2027


He knows all that lies open before them and all that is hidden from them: hence, they cannot intercede for any but those whom He has [already] graced with His goodly acceptance, since they themselves stand in reverent awe of Him. ^qAsad2027


He knoweth what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot intercede except for him whom He accepteth, and they quake for awe of Him. ^qPickthall2027


He knows what is before them and behind them, and they intercede not save for him with whom He is well-pleased, and they tremble in awe of Him. ^qArberry2027

# 29

Wa mai yaqul minhum inneee ilaahum min doonihee fazaalika najzeehi Jahannam; kazaalika najziz zaalimeen ^qTrans2028


And if any of them were to say, “Behold, I am deity beside Him” - that one We should requite with hell: thus do We requite all [such] evildoers. ^qAsad2028


And one of them who should say: Lo! I am a god beside Him, that one We should repay with hell. Thus We Repay wrong-doers. ^qPickthall2028


If any of them says, 'I am a god apart from Him', such a one We recompense with Gehenna; even so We recompense the evildoers. ^qArberry2028

# 30

Awalam yaral lazeena kafarooo annas samaawaati wal arda kaanataa ratqan faftaqnaahumaa wa ja'alnaa minal maaa'i kulla shai'in haiyin afalaa yu'minoon ^qTrans2029


ARE, THEN, they who are bent on denying the truth not aware that the heavens and the earth were [once] one single entity, which We then parted asunder? – and [that] We made out of water every living thing? Will they not, then, [begin to] believe? ^qAsad2029


Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were of one piece, then We parted them, and we made every living thing of water? Will they not then believe? ^qPickthall2029


Have not the unbelievers then beheld that the heavens and the earth were a mass all sewn up, and then We unstitched them and of water fashioned every living thing? Will they not believe? ^qArberry2029

# 31

Wa ja'alnaa fil ardi rawaasiya an tameeda bihim wa ja'alnaa feehaa fijaajan subulal la'allahum yahtadoon ^qTrans2030


And [are they not aware that] We have set up firm mountains on earth, lest it sway with them, and [that] We have appointed thereon broad paths, so that they might find their way, ^qAsad2030


And We have placed in the earth firm hills lest it quake with them, and We have placed therein ravines as roads that haply they may find their way. ^qPickthall2030


And We set in the earth firm mountains lest it should shake with them, and We set in it ravines to serve as ways, that haply so they may be guided; ^qArberry2030

# 32

Wa ja'alnas samaaa'a saqfam mahfoozanw wa hum 'an Aayaatihaa mu'ridoon ^qTrans2031


and [that] We have set up the sky as a canopy well-secured? And yet, they stubbornly turn away from [all] the signs of this [creation], ^qAsad2031


And we have made the sky a roof withheld (from them). Yet they turn away from its portents. ^qPickthall2031


and We set up the heaven as a roof well-protected; yet still from Our signs they are turning away. ^qArberry2031

# 33

Wa Huwal lazee khalaqal laila wannahaara washshamsa wal qamara kullun fee falakiny yashbahoon ^qTrans2032


and [fail to see that] it is He who has created the night and the day and the sun and the moon - all of them floating through space! ^qAsad2032


And He it is Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. They float, each in an orbit. ^qPickthall2032


It is He who created the night and the day, the sun and the moon, each swimming in a sky. ^qArberry2032

# 34

Wa maa ja'alnaa libasharim min qablikal khuld; afaimmitta fahumul khaalidoon ^qTrans2033


AND [remind those who deny thee, O Prophet, that] never have We granted life everlasting to any mortal before thee: but do they, perchance, hope that al­though thou must die, they will live forever?” ^qAsad2033


We appointed immortality for no mortal before thee. What! if thou diest, can they be immortal! ^qPickthall2033


We have not assigned to any mortal before thee to live forever; therefore, if thou diest, will they live forever? ^qArberry2033

# 35

Kullu nafsin zaaa'iqatul mawt; wa nablookum bishsharri walkhairi fitnatanw wa ilainaa turja'oon ^qTrans2034


Every human being is bound to taste death; and We test you [all] through the bad and the good [things of life] by way of trial: and unto Us you all must return. ^qAsad2034


Every soul must taste of death, and We try you with evil and with good, for ordeal. And unto Us ye will be returned. ^qPickthall2034


Every soul shall taste of death; and We try you with evil and good for a testing, then unto Us you shall be returned. ^qArberry2034

# 36

Wa izaa ra aakal lazeena kafarooo iny-yattakhizoonaka illa huzuwaa; ahaazal lazee yazkuru aalihatakum wa hum bi zikrir Rahmaani hum kaafiroon ^qTrans2035


But [thus it is:] whenever they who are bent on denying the truth consider thee, they make thee but a target of their mockery, [saying to one another,] “Is this the one who speaks [so contemptuously] of your gods?” and yet, it is they themselves who, at [every] mention of the Most Gracious, are wont to deny the truth! ^qAsad2035


And when those who disbelieve behold thee, they but choose thee out for mockery, (saying): Is this he who maketh mention of your gods? And they would deny all mention of the Beneficent. ^qPickthall2035


When the unbelievers behold thee, they take thee only for mockery: 'Ha, is this the one who makes mention of your gods?' Yet they in the Remembrance of the All-merciful are unbelievers. ^qArberry2035

# 37

Khuliqal insaanu min 'ajal; sa ureekum Aayaatee falaa tasta'jiloon ^qTrans2036


Man is a creature of haste; [but in time] I shall make obvious to you [the truth of] My mes­sages: do not, then, ask Me to hasten [it]! ^qAsad2036


Man is made of haste. I shall show you My portents, but ask Me not to hasten. ^qPickthall2036


Man was created of haste. Assuredly I shall show you My signs; so demand not that I make haste. ^qArberry2036

# 38

Wa yaqooloona mataa haazal wa'du in kuntum saadiqeen ^qTrans2037


But they [who reject My messages are wont to] ask, “When is that promise [of God’s judgment] to be fulfilled? [Answer this, O you who believe in it,] if you are men of truth!” ^qAsad2037


And they say: When will this promise (be fulfilled), if ye are truthful? ^qPickthall2037


They say, 'And when shall the promise come to pass, if you speak truly?' ^qArberry2037

# 39

Law ya'lamul lazeena kafaroo heena laa yakuffoona 'anw wujoohihimun Naara wa laa 'an zuhoorihim wa laa hum yunsaroon ^qTrans2038


If they but knew - they who are bent on deny­ing the truth - [that there will come] a time when they will not be able to ward off the fire from their faces, nor from their backs, and will not find any succour! ^qAsad2038


If those who disbelieved but knew the time when they will not be able to drive off the fire from their faces and from their backs, and they will not be helped! ^qPickthall2038


If the unbelievers but knew when that they shall not ward off the Fire from their faces nor from their backs, neither shall they be helped! ^qArberry2038

# 40

Bal taateehim baghtatan fatabhatuhum falaa yastatee'oona raddahaa wa laa hum yunzaroon ^qTrans2039


Nay, but [the Last Hour] will come upon them of a sudden, and will stupefy them: and they will be unable to avert it, and neither wilt they be allowed any respite. ^qAsad2039


Nay, but it will come upon them unawares so that it will stupefy them, and they will be unable to repel it, neither will they be reprieved. ^qPickthall2039


Nay, but it shall come upon them suddenly, dumbfounding them, and they shall not be able to repel it, nor shall they be respited. ^qArberry2039

# 41

Wa laqadis tuhzi'a bi-Rusulim min qablika fahaaqa billazeena sakhiroo minhum maa kaanoo bihee yastahzi'oon ^qTrans2040


And, indeed, [O Muhammad, even] before thy time have [God’s] apostles been derided - but those who scoffed at them were [in the end] overwhelmed by the very thing which they had been wont to deride. ^qAsad2040


Messengers before thee, indeed, were mocked, but that whereat they mocked surrounded those who scoffed at them. ^qPickthall2040


Messengers indeed were mocked at before thee, but those that scoffed at them were encompassed by that they mocked at. ^qArberry2040

# 42

Qul mai yakla 'ukum billaili wannahaari minar Rahmaan; bal hum 'an zikri Rabbihim mu'ridoon ^qTrans2041


Say: “Who could protect you, by night or by day, from the Most Gracious?” And yet, from a remembrance of their Sustainer do they stubbornly turn away! ^qAsad2041


Say: Who guardeth you in the night or in the day from the Beneficent? Nay, but they turn away from mention of their Lord! ^qPickthall2041


Say: 'Who shall guard you by night and in the daytime from the All-merciful?' Nay, but from the Remembrance of their Lord they are turning away. ^qArberry2041

AND [remember] him of the great fish when he went off in wrath, thinking that We had no power over him! But then heeded out in the deep darkness [of his distress]: “There is no deity save Thee! Limit­less art Thou in Thy glory! Verily, I have done wrong!” ^qAsad2086


And (mention) Dhu'n-Nun, when he went off in anger and deemed that We had no power over him, but he cried out in the darkness, saying: There is no Allah save Thee. Be Thou Glorified! Lo! I have been a wrong-doer. ^qPickthall2086


And Dhul Nun -- when he went forth enraged and thought that We would have no power over him; then he called out in the darkness, 'There is no god but Thou. Glory be to Thee! I have done evil.' ^qArberry2086

Fastajabnaa lahoo wa najjainaahu minal ghamm; wa kazaalika nunjil mu'mineen ^qTrans2087


And so We responded unto him and delivered him from [his] distress: for thus do We deliver all who have faith. ^qAsad2087


Then we heard his prayer and saved him from the anguish. Thus we save believers. ^qPickthall2087


So We answered him, and delivered him out of grief; even so do, We deliver the believers. ^qArberry2087

AND [thus did We deliver] Zachariah when he cried out unto his Sustainer: “O my Sustainer! Leave me not childless! But [even if Thou grant me no bodily heir, I know that] Thou wilt remain when all else has ceased to be!” ^qAsad2088


And Zachariah, when he cried unto his Lord: My Lord! Leave me not childless, though Thou art the Best of inheritors. ^qPickthall2088


And Zachariah -- when he called unto his Lord, 'O my Lord, leave me not solitary; though Thou art the best of inheritors.' ^qArberry2088

And so We responded unto him, and bestowed upon him the gift of John, having made his wife fit to bear him a child: [and,] verily, these [three] would vie with one another in doing good works, and would call unto Us in yearning and awe; and they were always humble before Us. ^qAsad2089


Then We heard his prayer, and bestowed upon him John, and adjusted his wife (to bear a child) for him. Lo! they used to vie one with the other in good deeds, and they cried unto Us in longing and in fear, and were submissive unto Us. ^qPickthall2089


So We answered him, and bestowed on him John, and We set his wife right for him; truly they vied with one another, hastening to good works, and called upon Us out of yearning and awe; and they were humble to Us. ^qArberry2089

AND [remember] her who guarded her chastity, whereupon We breathed into her of Our spirit and caused her, together with her son, to become a symbol [of Our grace] unto all people. ^qAsad2090


And she who was chaste, therefor We breathed into her (something) of Our Spirit and made her and her son a token for (all) peoples. ^qPickthall2090


And she who guarded her virginity, so We breathed into her of Our spirit and appointed her and her son to be a sign unto all beings. ^qArberry2090

VERILY, [O you who believe in Me,] this community of yours is one single community, since I am the Sustainer of you all: worship, then, Me [alone]! ^qAsad2091


Lo! this, your religion, is one religion, and I am your Lord, so worship Me. ^qPickthall2091


'Surely this community of yours is one community, and I am your Lord; so serve Me.' ^qArberry2091

But men have torn their unity wide asunder, [forgetting that] unto Us they all are bound to return. ^qAsad2092


And they have broken their religion (into fragments) among them, (yet) all are returning unto Us. ^qPickthall2092


But they split up their affair between them; all shall return to Us. ^qArberry2092

Famai ya'mal minas saalihaati wa huwa mu'minun falaa kufraana lisa'yihee wa innaa lahoo kaatiboon ^qTrans2093


And yet, whoever does [the least] of righteous deeds and is a believer withal, his endeavour shall not be disowned: for, behold, We shall record it in his favour. ^qAsad2093


Then whoso doeth some good works and is a believer, there will be no rejection of his effort. Lo! We record (it) for him. ^qPickthall2093


And whosoever does deeds of righteousness, being a believer, no unthankfulness shall befall his endeavour; We Ourselves write it down for him. ^qArberry2093

Hence, it has been unfailingly true of any community whom We have ever destroyed that they [were people who] would never turn back [from their sinful ways] ^qAsad2094


And there is a ban upon any community which We have destroyed: that they shall not return. ^qPickthall2094

the while the true promise [of resurrection] draws close [to its fulfillment]. But then, lo! the eyes of those who [in their lifetime] were bent on denying the truth will stare in horror, [and they will exclaim:] “Oh, woe unto us! We were indeed heedless of this [promise of resur­rection]! - nay, we were [bent on] doing evil!” ^qAsad2096


And the True Promise draweth nigh; then behold them, staring wide (in terror), the eyes of those who disbelieve! (They say): Alas for us! We (lived) in forgetfulness of this. Ah, but we were wrong-doers! ^qPickthall2096


and nigh has drawn the true promise, and behold, the eyes of the unbelievers staring: 'Alas for us! We were heedless of this; 'nay, we were evildoers.' ^qArberry2096

[Then they will be told:] “Verily, you and all that you [were wont to] worship instead of God are but the fuel of hell: that is what you are destined for. ^qAsad2097


Lo! ye (idolaters) and that which ye worship beside Allah are fuel of hell. Thereunto ye will come. ^qPickthall2097

If those [false objects of your worship] had truly been divine, they would not have been destined for it: but [as it is, you] all shall abide therein!” ^qAsad2098


If these had been gods they would not have come thither, but all will abide therein. ^qPickthall2098

They will not hear the slightest sound thereof, while they abide in that which their souls desire. ^qPickthall20101

The Day when We shall roll up the heavens as a recorder rolleth up a written scroll. As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it. (It is) a promise (binding) upon Us. Lo! We are to perform it. ^qPickthall20103
