Iqtaraba linnaasi hisaa buhum wa hum fee ghaflatim mu'ridoon ^qTrans211


CLOSER DRAWS unto men their reckoning: and yet they remain stubbornly heedless [of its approach]. ^qAsad211


Their reckoning draweth nigh for mankind, while they turn away in heedlessness. ^qPickthall211


Nigh unto men has drawn their reckoning, while they in heedlessness are yet turning away; ^qArberry211

# 2

Maa yaateehim min zikrim mir Rabbihim muhdasin illas tama'oohu wa hum yal'aboon ^qTrans212


Whenever there comes unto them any new re­minder from their Sustainer, they but listen to it with playful amusement, ^qAsad212


Never cometh there unto them a new reminder from their Lord but they listen to it while they play, ^qPickthall212


no Remembrance from their Lord comes to them lately renewed, but they listen to it yet playing, ^qArberry212

# 3

Laahiyatan quloobuhum; wa asarrun najwal lazeena zalamoo hal haazaa illaa basharum mislukum afataa toonas sihra wa antum tubsiroon ^qTrans213


their hearts set on passing ­delights; yet they who are [thus] bent on wrongdoing conceal their innermost thoughts [when they say to one another], “Is this [Muhammad] anything but a mortal like yourselves? Will you, then, yield to [his] spellbinding eloquence with your eyes open?” ^qAsad213


With hearts preoccupied. And they confer in secret. The wrong-doers say: Is this other than a mortal like you? Will ye then succumb to magic when ye see (it)? ^qPickthall213


diverted their hearts. The evildoers whisper one to another, 'Is this aught but a mortal like to yourselves? What, will you take to sorcery with your eyes open?' ^qArberry213

# 4

Qaala Rabbee ya'lamul qawla fis samaaa'i wal ardi wa Huwas Samee'ul Aleem ^qTrans214


Say: “My Sustainer knows whatever is spoken in heaven and on earth; and He alone is all-hearing, all-knowing.” ^qAsad214


He saith: My Lord knoweth what is spoken in the heaven and the earth. He is the Hearer, the Knower. ^qPickthall214


He says: 'My Lord knows what is said in the heavens and the earth, and He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.' ^qArberry214

# 5

Bal qaalooo adghaasu ahlaamim balif taraahu bal huwa shaa'irun falyaatinaa bi Aayatin kamaa ursilal awwaloon ^qTrans215


“Nay,” they say, “[Muhammad propounds] the most involved and confusing of dreams!” “Nay, but he has invented [all] this!” - “Nay, but he is [only] a poet!” - [and,] “Let him, then, come unto us with a miracle, just as those [prophets] of old were sent [with miracles]?” ^qAsad215


Nay, say they, (these are but) muddled dreams; nay, he hath but invented it; nay, he is but a poet. Let him bring us a portent even as those of old (who were Allah's messengers) were sent (with portents). ^qPickthall215


Nay, but they say: 'A hotchpotch of nightmares! Nay, he has forged it; nay, he is a poet! Now therefore let him bring us a sign, even as the ancient ones were sent as Messengers.' ^qArberry215

# 6

Maaa aaamanat qablahum min qaryatin ahlaknaahaa a-fahum yu'minoon ^qTrans216


Not one of the communities that We destroyed in bygone times would ever believe [their prophets]: will these, then, [be more willing to] believe? ^qAsad216


Not a township believed of those which We destroyed before them (though We sent them portents): would they then believe? ^qPickthall216


Not one city that We destroyed before them believed; what then, will they not believe? ^qArberry216

# 7

Wa maaa arsalnaa qablaka illaa rijaalan nooheee ilaihim fas'aloo ahlaz zikri in kuntum laa ta'lamoon ^qTrans217


For [even] before thy time, [O Muhammad,] We never sent [as Our apostles] any but [mortal] men, whom We inspired - hence, [tell the deniers of the truth,] “If you do not know this, ask the followers of earlier revelation” ^qAsad217


And We sent not (as Our messengers) before thee other than men, whom We inspired. Ask the followers of the Reminder if ye know not? ^qPickthall217


And We sent none before thee, but men to whom We made revelation -- question the People of the Remembrance, if you do not know -- ^qArberry217

# 8

Wa maa ja'alnaahum jasadal laa yaakuloonat ta'aama wa maa kaanoo khaalideen ^qTrans218


and neither did We endow them with bodies that could dispense with food nor were they immortal. ^qAsad218


We gave them not bodies that would not eat food, nor were they immortals. ^qPickthall218


nor did We fashion them as bodies that ate not food, neither were they immortal; ^qArberry218

# 9

summa sadaqnaa humul wa'da fa-anjainaahum wa man nashaaa'u wa ahlaknal musrifeen ^qTrans219


In the end, We made good unto them Our promise, and We saved them and all whom We willed [to save], and We destroyed those who had wasted their own selves. ^qAsad219


Then we fulfilled the promise unto them. So we delivered them and whom We would, and We destroyed the prodigals. ^qPickthall219


then We made true the promise We gave them and We delivered them, and whomsoever We would; and We destroyed the prodigal. ^qArberry219

# 10

Laqad anzalnaaa ilaikum Kitaaban feehi zikrukum afalaa ta'qiloon ^qTrans2110


[O MEN!] We have now bestowed upon you from on high a divine writ containing all that you ought to bear in mind will you not, then, use your reason? ^qAsad2110


Now We have revealed unto you a Scripture wherein is your Reminder. Have ye then no sense? ^qPickthall2110


Now We have sent down to you a Book wherein is your Remembrance; will you not understand? ^qArberry2110

# 11

Wa kam qasamnaa min qaryatin kannat zaalimatanw wa anshadnaa ba'dahaa qawman aakhareen ^qTrans2111


For, how many a community that persisted in evildoing have We dashed into fragments, and raised another people in its stead! ^qAsad2111


How many a community that dealt unjustly have We shattered, and raised up after them another folk! ^qPickthall2111


How many a city that was evildoing We have shattered, and set up after it another people! ^qArberry2111

# 12

Falammaaa ahassoo baasanaaa izaaa hum minhaa yarkudoon ^qTrans2112


And [every time,] as soon as they began to feel Our punishing might, lo! they tried to flee from it ^qAsad2112


And, when they felt Our might, behold them fleeing from it! ^qPickthall2112


Then, when they perceived Our might, behold, they ran headlong out of it. ^qArberry2112

# 13

Laa tarkudoo warji'ooo ilaa maaa utriftum feehe wa masaakinikum la'allakum tus'aloon ^qTrans2113


[and at the same time they seemed to hear a scornful voice]: “Do not try to flee, but return to all that [once] gave you pleasure and corrupted your whole being. and [return] to your homes, so that you might be called to account [for what you have done]!” ^qAsad2113


(But it was said unto them): Flee not, but return to that (existence) which emasculated you and to your dwellings, that ye may be questioned. ^qPickthall2113


'Run not! Return you unto the luxury that you exulted in, and your dwelling-places; haply you shall be questioned.' ^qArberry2113

# 14

Qaaloo yaa wailanaaa innaa kunnaa zaalimeen ^qTrans2114


And they could only cry: “Oh, woe unto us! Verily, we were wrongdoers!” ^qAsad2114


They cried: Alas for us! we were wrong-doers. ^qPickthall2114


They said, 'Alas for us! We have been evildoers.' ^qArberry2114

# 15

Famaa zaalat tilka da'waahum hattaa ja'alnaahum haseedan khaamideen ^qTrans2115


And that cry of theirs did not cease until We caused them to become [like] a field mown down, still and silent as ashes. ^qAsad2115


And this their crying ceased not till We made them as reaped corn, extinct. ^qPickthall2115


So they ceased not to cry, until We made them stubble, silent and still. ^qArberry2115

# 16

Wa maa khalaqnas samaaa'a wal arda wa maa bainahumaa laa'ibeen ^qTrans2116


AND [know that] We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in mere idle play: ^qAsad2116


We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in play. ^qPickthall2116


We created not the heaven and the earth, and whatsoever between them is, as playing; ^qArberry2116

# 17

Law aradnaaa an nattakhiza lahwal lat takhaznaahu mil ladunnaaa in kunnaa faa'ileen ^qTrans2117


[for,] had We willed to indulge in a pastime, We would indeed have produced it from within Ourselves - if such had been Our will at all! ^qAsad2117


If We had wished to find a pastime, We could have found it in Our presence - if We ever did. ^qPickthall2117


had We desired to take to Us a diversion We would have taken it to Us from Ourselves, had We done aught. ^qArberry2117

# 18

Bal naqzifu bilhaqqi 'alal baatili fa yadmaghuhoo fa izaa huwa zaahiq; wa lakumul wailu mimmaa tasifoon ^qTrans2118


Nay, but [by the very act of creation] We hurl the truth against falsehood, and it crushes the latter: and lo! it withers away. But woe unto you for all your [attempts at] defining [God] – ^qAsad2118


Nay, but We hurl the true against the false, and it doth break its head and lo! it vanisheth. And yours will be woe for that which ye ascribe (unto Him). ^qPickthall2118


Nay, but We hurl the truth against falsehood and it prevails over it, and behold, falsehood vanishes away. Then woe to you for that you describe! ^qArberry2118

# 19

Wa lahoo man fis samaawaati wal ard; wa man 'indahoo laa yastakbiroona 'an 'ibaada tihee wa laa yastahsiroon ^qTrans2119


for, unto Him belong all [beings] that are in the heavens and on earth; and those that are with Him are never too proud to worship Him and never grow weary [thereof]: ^qAsad2119


Unto Him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those who dwell in His presence are not too proud to worship Him, nor do they weary; ^qPickthall2119


To Him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and the earth; and those who are with Him wax not too proud to do Him service neither grow weary, ^qArberry2119

# 20

Yusabbihoona laila wannahaara laa yafturoon ^qTrans2120


they extol His lim­itless glory by night and by day, never flagging [therein]. ^qAsad2120


They glorify (Him) night and day; they flag not. ^qPickthall2120


glorifying Him by night and in the daytime and never failing. ^qArberry2120

# 21

Amit takhazooo aalihatam minal ardi hum yunshiroon ^qTrans2121


And yet some people choose to worship certain earthly things or beings as deities that [are supposed to] resurrect [the dead; and they fail to realize that], ^qAsad2121


Or have they chosen gods from the earth who raise the dead? ^qPickthall2121


Or have they taken gods out of the earth who raise the dead? ^qArberry2121

# 22

Law kaana feehimaaa aalihatun illal laahu lafasadataa; fa-Subhaanal laahi Rabbil 'Arshi 'ammaa yasifoon ^qTrans2122


had there been in heaven or on earth any deities other than God, both [those realms would surely have fallen into ruin! But limitless in His glory is God, enthroned in His awesome almightiness far] above anything that men may devise by way of definition! ^qAsad2122


If there were therein gods beside Allah, then verily both (the heavens and the earth) had been disordered. Glorified be Allah, the Lord of the Throne, from all that they ascribe (unto Him). ^qPickthall2122


Why, were there gods in earth and heaven other than God, they would surely go to ruin; so glory be to God, the Lord of the Throne, above that they describe! ^qArberry2122

# 23

Laa yus'alu 'ammaa yaf'alu wa hum yus'aloon ^qTrans2123


He cannot be called to account for whatever He does, whereas they will be called to account: ^qAsad2123


He will not be questioned as to that which He doeth, but they will be questioned. ^qPickthall2123


He shall not be questioned as to what He does, but they shall he questioned. ^qArberry2123

# 24

Amit takhazoo min doonihee aalihatan qul haatoo burhaanakum haaza zikru mam ma'iya wa zikru man qablee; bal aksaruhum laa ya'lamoonal haqqa fahum mu'ridoon ^qTrans2124


and yet, they choose to worship [imaginary] deities instead of Him! Say [O Prophet]: “Produce an evidence for what you are claiming: this is a reminder [unceasingly voiced] by those who are with me, just as it was a reminder [voiced] by those who came before me.” But nay, most of them do not know the truth, and so they stubbornly turn away [from it] ^qAsad2124


Or have they chosen other gods beside Him? say: Bring your proof (of their godhead). This is the Reminder of those with me and those before me, but most of them know not the Truth and so they are averse. ^qPickthall2124


Or have they taken gods apart from Him? Say: 'Bring your proof! This is the Remembrance of him who is with me, and the Remembrance of those before me. Nay, but the most part of them know not the truth, so therefore they are turning away. ^qArberry2124

# 25

Wa maaa arsalnaa min qablika mir Rasoolin illaa nooheee ilaihi annahoo laaa ilaaha illaaa Ana fa'budoon ^qTrans2125


and [this despite the fact that even] before thy time We never sent any apostle without having revealed to him that there is no deity save Me, - [and that,] therefore, you shall worship Me [alone]! ^qAsad2125


And We sent no messenger before thee but We inspired him, (saying): There is no Allah save Me (Allah), so worship Me. ^qPickthall2125


And We sent never a Messenger before thee except that We revealed to him, saying, 'There is no god but I; so serve Me.' ^qArberry2125

# 26

Wa qaalut takhazar Rahmaanu waladan Subhaanah; bal 'ibaadum mkkramoon ^qTrans2126


And [yet,] some say, “The Most Gracious has taken unto Himself a son”! Limitless is He in His glory! Nay, [those whom they regard as God’s “offspring” are but His] honoured servants: ^qAsad2126


And they say: The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son. Be He Glorified! Nay, but (those whom they call sons) are honoured slaves; ^qPickthall2126


They say:' 'The All-merciful has taken to Him a son.' Glory be to Him! Nay, but they are honoured servants ^qArberry2126

# 27

Laa yasbiqoonahoo bil qawli wa hum bi amrihee ya'maloon ^qTrans2127


they speak not until He has spoken unto them, and [whenever they act,] they act at His behest. ^qAsad2127


They speak not until He hath spoken, and they act by His command. ^qPickthall2127


that outstrip Him not in speech, and perform as He commands. ^qArberry2127

# 28

Ya'lamu maa baina aideehim wa maa khalfahum wa laa yashfa'oona illaa limanir tadaa wa hum min khash yatihee mushfiqoon ^qTrans2128


He knows all that lies open before them and all that is hidden from them: hence, they cannot intercede for any but those whom He has [already] graced with His goodly acceptance, since they themselves stand in reverent awe of Him. ^qAsad2128


He knoweth what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot intercede except for him whom He accepteth, and they quake for awe of Him. ^qPickthall2128


He knows what is before them and behind them, and they intercede not save for him with whom He is well-pleased, and they tremble in awe of Him. ^qArberry2128

# 29

Wa mai yaqul minhum inneee ilaahum min doonihee fazaalika najzeehi Jahannam; kazaalika najziz zaalimeen ^qTrans2129


And if any of them were to say, “Behold, I am deity beside Him” - that one We should requite with hell: thus do We requite all [such] evildoers. ^qAsad2129


And one of them who should say: Lo! I am a god beside Him, that one We should repay with hell. Thus We Repay wrong-doers. ^qPickthall2129


If any of them says, 'I am a god apart from Him', such a one We recompense with Gehenna; even so We recompense the evildoers. ^qArberry2129

# 30

Awalam yaral lazeena kafarooo annas samaawaati wal arda kaanataa ratqan faftaqnaahumaa wa ja'alnaa minal maaa'i kulla shai'in haiyin afalaa yu'minoon ^qTrans2130


ARE, THEN, they who are bent on denying the truth not aware that the heavens and the earth were [once] one single entity, which We then parted asunder? – and [that] We made out of water every living thing? Will they not, then, [begin to] believe? ^qAsad2130


Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were of one piece, then We parted them, and we made every living thing of water? Will they not then believe? ^qPickthall2130


Have not the unbelievers then beheld that the heavens and the earth were a mass all sewn up, and then We unstitched them and of water fashioned every living thing? Will they not believe? ^qArberry2130

# 31

Wa ja'alnaa fil ardi rawaasiya an tameeda bihim wa ja'alnaa feehaa fijaajan subulal la'allahum yahtadoon ^qTrans2131


And [are they not aware that] We have set up firm mountains on earth, lest it sway with them, and [that] We have appointed thereon broad paths, so that they might find their way, ^qAsad2131


And We have placed in the earth firm hills lest it quake with them, and We have placed therein ravines as roads that haply they may find their way. ^qPickthall2131


And We set in the earth firm mountains lest it should shake with them, and We set in it ravines to serve as ways, that haply so they may be guided; ^qArberry2131

# 32

Wa ja'alnas samaaa'a saqfam mahfoozanw wa hum 'an Aayaatihaa mu'ridoon ^qTrans2132


and [that] We have set up the sky as a canopy well-secured? And yet, they stubbornly turn away from [all] the signs of this [creation], ^qAsad2132


And we have made the sky a roof withheld (from them). Yet they turn away from its portents. ^qPickthall2132


and We set up the heaven as a roof well-protected; yet still from Our signs they are turning away. ^qArberry2132

# 33

Wa Huwal lazee khalaqal laila wannahaara washshamsa wal qamara kullun fee falakiny yashbahoon ^qTrans2133


and [fail to see that] it is He who has created the night and the day and the sun and the moon - all of them floating through space! ^qAsad2133


And He it is Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. They float, each in an orbit. ^qPickthall2133


It is He who created the night and the day, the sun and the moon, each swimming in a sky. ^qArberry2133

# 34

Wa maa ja'alnaa libasharim min qablikal khuld; afaimmitta fahumul khaalidoon ^qTrans2134


AND [remind those who deny thee, O Prophet, that] never have We granted life everlasting to any mortal before thee: but do they, perchance, hope that al­though thou must die, they will live forever?” ^qAsad2134


We appointed immortality for no mortal before thee. What! if thou diest, can they be immortal! ^qPickthall2134


We have not assigned to any mortal before thee to live forever; therefore, if thou diest, will they live forever? ^qArberry2134

# 35

Kullu nafsin zaaa'iqatul mawt; wa nablookum bishsharri walkhairi fitnatanw wa ilainaa turja'oon ^qTrans2135


Every human being is bound to taste death; and We test you [all] through the bad and the good [things of life] by way of trial: and unto Us you all must return. ^qAsad2135


Every soul must taste of death, and We try you with evil and with good, for ordeal. And unto Us ye will be returned. ^qPickthall2135


Every soul shall taste of death; and We try you with evil and good for a testing, then unto Us you shall be returned. ^qArberry2135

# 36

Wa izaa ra aakal lazeena kafarooo iny-yattakhizoonaka illa huzuwaa; ahaazal lazee yazkuru aalihatakum wa hum bi zikrir Rahmaani hum kaafiroon ^qTrans2136


But [thus it is:] whenever they who are bent on denying the truth consider thee, they make thee but a target of their mockery, [saying to one another,] “Is this the one who speaks [so contemptuously] of your gods?” and yet, it is they themselves who, at [every] mention of the Most Gracious, are wont to deny the truth! ^qAsad2136


And when those who disbelieve behold thee, they but choose thee out for mockery, (saying): Is this he who maketh mention of your gods? And they would deny all mention of the Beneficent. ^qPickthall2136


When the unbelievers behold thee, they take thee only for mockery: 'Ha, is this the one who makes mention of your gods?' Yet they in the Remembrance of the All-merciful are unbelievers. ^qArberry2136

# 37

Khuliqal insaanu min 'ajal; sa ureekum Aayaatee falaa tasta'jiloon ^qTrans2137


Man is a creature of haste; [but in time] I shall make obvious to you [the truth of] My mes­sages: do not, then, ask Me to hasten [it]! ^qAsad2137


Man is made of haste. I shall show you My portents, but ask Me not to hasten. ^qPickthall2137


Man was created of haste. Assuredly I shall show you My signs; so demand not that I make haste. ^qArberry2137

# 38

Wa yaqooloona mataa haazal wa'du in kuntum saadiqeen ^qTrans2138


But they [who reject My messages are wont to] ask, “When is that promise [of God’s judgment] to be fulfilled? [Answer this, O you who believe in it,] if you are men of truth!” ^qAsad2138


And they say: When will this promise (be fulfilled), if ye are truthful? ^qPickthall2138


They say, 'And when shall the promise come to pass, if you speak truly?' ^qArberry2138

# 39

Law ya'lamul lazeena kafaroo heena laa yakuffoona 'anw wujoohihimun Naara wa laa 'an zuhoorihim wa laa hum yunsaroon ^qTrans2139


If they but knew - they who are bent on deny­ing the truth - [that there will come] a time when they will not be able to ward off the fire from their faces, nor from their backs, and will not find any succour! ^qAsad2139


If those who disbelieved but knew the time when they will not be able to drive off the fire from their faces and from their backs, and they will not be helped! ^qPickthall2139


If the unbelievers but knew when that they shall not ward off the Fire from their faces nor from their backs, neither shall they be helped! ^qArberry2139

# 40

Bal taateehim baghtatan fatabhatuhum falaa yastatee'oona raddahaa wa laa hum yunzaroon ^qTrans2140


Nay, but [the Last Hour] will come upon them of a sudden, and will stupefy them: and they will be unable to avert it, and neither wilt they be allowed any respite. ^qAsad2140


Nay, but it will come upon them unawares so that it will stupefy them, and they will be unable to repel it, neither will they be reprieved. ^qPickthall2140


Nay, but it shall come upon them suddenly, dumbfounding them, and they shall not be able to repel it, nor shall they be respited. ^qArberry2140

# 41

Wa laqadis tuhzi'a bi-Rusulim min qablika fahaaqa billazeena sakhiroo minhum maa kaanoo bihee yastahzi'oon ^qTrans2141


And, indeed, [O Muhammad, even] before thy time have [God’s] apostles been derided - but those who scoffed at them were [in the end] overwhelmed by the very thing which they had been wont to deride. ^qAsad2141


Messengers before thee, indeed, were mocked, but that whereat they mocked surrounded those who scoffed at them. ^qPickthall2141


Messengers indeed were mocked at before thee, but those that scoffed at them were encompassed by that they mocked at. ^qArberry2141

# 42

Qul mai yakla 'ukum billaili wannahaari minar Rahmaan; bal hum 'an zikri Rabbihim mu'ridoon ^qTrans2142


Say: “Who could protect you, by night or by day, from the Most Gracious?” And yet, from a remembrance of their Sustainer do they stubbornly turn away! ^qAsad2142


Say: Who guardeth you in the night or in the day from the Beneficent? Nay, but they turn away from mention of their Lord! ^qPickthall2142

AND [remember] him of the great fish when he went off in wrath, thinking that We had no power over him! But then heeded out in the deep darkness [of his distress]: “There is no deity save Thee! Limit­less art Thou in Thy glory! Verily, I have done wrong!” ^qAsad2187


And (mention) Dhu'n-Nun, when he went off in anger and deemed that We had no power over him, but he cried out in the darkness, saying: There is no Allah save Thee. Be Thou Glorified! Lo! I have been a wrong-doer. ^qPickthall2187


And Dhul Nun -- when he went forth enraged and thought that We would have no power over him; then he called out in the darkness, 'There is no god but Thou. Glory be to Thee! I have done evil.' ^qArberry2187

Fastajabnaa lahoo wa najjainaahu minal ghamm; wa kazaalika nunjil mu'mineen ^qTrans2188


And so We responded unto him and delivered him from [his] distress: for thus do We deliver all who have faith. ^qAsad2188


Then we heard his prayer and saved him from the anguish. Thus we save believers. ^qPickthall2188


So We answered him, and delivered him out of grief; even so do, We deliver the believers. ^qArberry2188

AND [thus did We deliver] Zachariah when he cried out unto his Sustainer: “O my Sustainer! Leave me not childless! But [even if Thou grant me no bodily heir, I know that] Thou wilt remain when all else has ceased to be!” ^qAsad2189


And Zachariah, when he cried unto his Lord: My Lord! Leave me not childless, though Thou art the Best of inheritors. ^qPickthall2189


And Zachariah -- when he called unto his Lord, 'O my Lord, leave me not solitary; though Thou art the best of inheritors.' ^qArberry2189

And so We responded unto him, and bestowed upon him the gift of John, having made his wife fit to bear him a child: [and,] verily, these [three] would vie with one another in doing good works, and would call unto Us in yearning and awe; and they were always humble before Us. ^qAsad2190


Then We heard his prayer, and bestowed upon him John, and adjusted his wife (to bear a child) for him. Lo! they used to vie one with the other in good deeds, and they cried unto Us in longing and in fear, and were submissive unto Us. ^qPickthall2190


So We answered him, and bestowed on him John, and We set his wife right for him; truly they vied with one another, hastening to good works, and called upon Us out of yearning and awe; and they were humble to Us. ^qArberry2190

AND [remember] her who guarded her chastity, whereupon We breathed into her of Our spirit and caused her, together with her son, to become a symbol [of Our grace] unto all people. ^qAsad2191


And she who was chaste, therefor We breathed into her (something) of Our Spirit and made her and her son a token for (all) peoples. ^qPickthall2191


And she who guarded her virginity, so We breathed into her of Our spirit and appointed her and her son to be a sign unto all beings. ^qArberry2191

VERILY, [O you who believe in Me,] this community of yours is one single community, since I am the Sustainer of you all: worship, then, Me [alone]! ^qAsad2192


Lo! this, your religion, is one religion, and I am your Lord, so worship Me. ^qPickthall2192


'Surely this community of yours is one community, and I am your Lord; so serve Me.' ^qArberry2192

Wa taqatta'ooo amrahum bainahum kullun ilainaaa raaji'oon ^qTrans2193


But men have torn their unity wide asunder, [forgetting that] unto Us they all are bound to return. ^qAsad2193


And they have broken their religion (into fragments) among them, (yet) all are returning unto Us. ^qPickthall2193


But they split up their affair between them; all shall return to Us. ^qArberry2193

Famai ya'mal minas saalihaati wa huwa mu'minun falaa kufraana lisa'yihee wa innaa lahoo kaatiboon ^qTrans2194


And yet, whoever does [the least] of righteous deeds and is a believer withal, his endeavour shall not be disowned: for, behold, We shall record it in his favour. ^qAsad2194


Then whoso doeth some good works and is a believer, there will be no rejection of his effort. Lo! We record (it) for him. ^qPickthall2194


And whosoever does deeds of righteousness, being a believer, no unthankfulness shall befall his endeavour; We Ourselves write it down for him. ^qArberry2194

Wa haraamun 'alaa qaryatin ahlaknaahaaa annahum laa yarji'oon ^qTrans2195


Hence, it has been unfailingly true of any community whom We have ever destroyed that they [were people who] would never turn back [from their sinful ways] ^qAsad2195


And there is a ban upon any community which We have destroyed: that they shall not return. ^qPickthall2195

Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose, and they hasten out of every mound, ^qPickthall2196


till, when Gog and Magog are unloosed, and they slide down out of every slope, ^qArberry2196

the while the true promise [of resurrection] draws close [to its fulfillment]. But then, lo! the eyes of those who [in their lifetime] were bent on denying the truth will stare in horror, [and they will exclaim:] “Oh, woe unto us! We were indeed heedless of this [promise of resur­rection]! - nay, we were [bent on] doing evil!” ^qAsad2197


And the True Promise draweth nigh; then behold them, staring wide (in terror), the eyes of those who disbelieve! (They say): Alas for us! We (lived) in forgetfulness of this. Ah, but we were wrong-doers! ^qPickthall2197


and nigh has drawn the true promise, and behold, the eyes of the unbelievers staring: 'Alas for us! We were heedless of this; 'nay, we were evildoers.' ^qArberry2197

[Then they will be told:] “Verily, you and all that you [were wont to] worship instead of God are but the fuel of hell: that is what you are destined for. ^qAsad2198


Lo! ye (idolaters) and that which ye worship beside Allah are fuel of hell. Thereunto ye will come. ^qPickthall2198


'Surely you, and that you were serving apart from God, are fuel for Gehenna; you shall go down to it.' ^qArberry2198

If those [false objects of your worship] had truly been divine, they would not have been destined for it: but [as it is, you] all shall abide therein!” ^qAsad2199


If these had been gods they would not have come thither, but all will abide therein. ^qPickthall2199


If those had been gods, they would never have gone down to it; yet every one of them shall therein abide forever;' ^qArberry2199

Lo! those unto whom kindness hath gone forth before from Us, they will be far removed from thence. ^qPickthall21101

They will not hear the slightest sound thereof, while they abide in that which their souls desire. ^qPickthall21102

The supreme awesomeness [of the Day of Resurrection] will cause them no grief, since the angels will receive them with the greeting. “This is your Day [of triumph - the Day] which you were promised!” ^qAsad21103


The Supreme Horror will not grieve them, and the angels will welcome them, (saying): This is your Day which ye were promised; ^qPickthall21103

The Day when We shall roll up the heavens as a recorder rolleth up a written scroll. As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it. (It is) a promise (binding) upon Us. Lo! We are to perform it. ^qPickthall21104

AND, INDEED, after having exhorted [man], We laid it down in all the books of divine wisdom that My righteous servants shall inherit the earth: ^qAsad21105


And verily we have written in the Scripture, after the Reminder: My righteous slaves will inherit the earth: ^qPickthall21105
