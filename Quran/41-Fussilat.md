Wa ja'ala feehaa rawaa siya min fawqihaa wa baaraka feehaa wa qaddara feehaaaa aqwaatahaa feee arba'ati ayyaamin sawaaa'al lissaaa'ileen ^qTrans409


For He [it is who, after creating the earth,] placed firm mountains on it, [towering] above its surface, and bestowed [so many] blessings on it, and equitably apportioned its means of subsistence to all who would seek it: [and all this He created] in four aeons. ^qAsad409

And He [it is who] applied His design to the skies, which were [yet but] smoke; and He [it is who] said to them and to the earth, “Come [into being], both of you, willingly or unwillingly!” - to which both responded, “We do come in obedience.” ^qAsad4010

Then He lifted Himself to heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth, "Come willingly, or unwillingly!" They said, "We come willingly." ^qArberry4010

And He [it is who] decreed that they become seven heavens in two aeons, and imparted unto each heaven its function. And We adorned the skies nearest to the earth with lights, and made them secure: such is the ordaining of the Almighty, the All-Knowing. ^qAsad4011


Then He ordained them seven heavens in two Days and inspired in each heaven its mandate; and We decked the nether heaven with lamps, and rendered it inviolable. That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Knower. ^qPickthall4011

BUT IF they turn away, say: “I warn you of [the coming of] a thunderbolt of punishment like the thunderbolt [that fell upon the tribes] of Ad and Thamud!” ^qAsad4012


But if they turn away, then say: I warn you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt (which fell of old upon the tribes) of A'ad and Thamud; ^qPickthall4012


And We adorned the lower heaven with lamps, and to reserve; that is the ordaining of the All-mighty, the All-knowing. But if they turn away, then say, 'I warn you of a thunderbolt like to the thunderbolt of Ad and Thamood.' ^qArberry4012

Lo! There came unto them [God’s] apostles, speaking of what lay open before them and what was [still] beyond their ken, [and calling unto them,] “Worship none but God!” They answered: “If our Sustainer had willed [us to believe in what you say], He would have sent down angels [as His message-bearers]. As it is, behold, we deny that there is any truth in what you [claim to] have been sent with!” ^qAsad4013


When their messengers came unto them from before them and behind them, saying: Worship none but Allah! they said: If our Lord had willed, He surely would have sent down angels (unto us), so lo! we are disbelievers in that wherewith ye have been sent. ^qPickthall4013


When the Messengers came unto them from before them and from behind them, saying, 'Serve none but God,' they said, 'Had our Lord willed, surely He would have sent down angels; so we disbelieve in the Message you were sent with.' ^qArberry4013

# 15

Fa ammaa 'Aadun fastak baroo fil ardi bighairul haqqi wa qaaloo man ashaddu minnaa quwwatan awalam yaraw annal laahal lazee khalaqahum Huwa ashaddu minhum quwwatanw wa kaanoo bi Aayaatinaa yajhadoon ^qTrans4014


Now as for [the tribe of] Ad, they walked arrogantly on earth, [offending] against all right, and saying, “Who could have a power greater than ours?” Why - were they, then, not aware that God, who created them, had a power greater than theirs? But they went on rejecting Our messages; ^qAsad4014


As for A'ad, they were arrogant in the land without right, and they said: Who is mightier than us in power? Could they not see that Allah Who created them, He was mightier than them in power? And they denied Our revelations. ^qPickthall4014


As for Ad, they waxed proud in the earth without right, and they said, 'Who is stronger than we in might?' What, did they not see that God, who created them, was stronger than they in might? And they denied Our signs. ^qArberry4014

# 16

Fa arsalnaa 'alaihim reehan sarsaran feee ayyaamin nahisaatil linuzeeqahum 'azaabal khizyi fil hayaatid dunyaa wa la'azaabul Aakhirati akhzaa wa hum laa yunsaroon ^qTrans4015


and thereupon We let loose upon them a storm wind raging through days of misfortune, so as to give them, in the life of this world, a foretaste of suffering through humiliation: but [their] suffering in the life to come will be far more humiliating, and they will have none to succour them. ^qAsad4015


Therefor We let loose on them a raging wind in evil days, that We might make them taste the torment of disgrace in the life of the world. And verily the doom of the Hereafter will be more shameful, and they will not be helped. ^qPickthall4015


Then We loosed against them a wind clamorous in days of ill fortune, that We might let them taste the chastisement of degradation in the present life; and the chastisement of the world to come is even more degrading, and they shall not be helped. ^qArberry4015

# 17

Wa ammaa Samoodu fahadinaahum fastahabbul 'ama 'alal huda fa akhazathum saa'iqatul 'azaabil hooni bimaa kaanoo yaksiboon ^qTrans4016


And as for [the tribe of] Thamud, We offered them guidance, but they chose blindness in pre­ference to guidance: and so the thunderbolt of shame­ful suffering fell upon them as an outcome of all [the evil] that they had wrought; ^qAsad4016


And as for Thamud, We gave them guidance, but they preferred blindness to the guidance, so the bolt of the doom of humiliation overtook them because of what they used to earn. ^qPickthall4016


As for Thamood, We guided them, but they preferred blindness above guidance, so the thunderbolt of the chastisement of humiliation seized them for that they were earning. ^qArberry4016

# 18

Wa najjainal lazeena aamanoo wa kaanoo yattaqoon ^qTrans4017


and We saved [only] those who had attained to faith and were conscious of Us. ^qAsad4017


And We delivered those who believed and used to keep their duty to Allah. ^qPickthall4017


And We delivered those who believed and were godfearing. ^qArberry4017

# 19

Wa yawma yuhsharu a'daaa'ul laahi ilan Naari fahum yooza'oon ^qTrans4018


Hence, [warn all men of] the Day when the enemies of God shall be gathered together before the fire, and then shall be driven onward, ^qAsad4018


And (make mention of) the day when the enemies of Allah are gathered unto the Fire, they are driven on ^qPickthall4018


Upon the day when God's enemies are mustered to the Fire, duly disposed, ^qArberry4018

# 20

Hattaaa izaa maa jaaa'oohaa shahida 'alaihim samu'uhum wa absaaruhum wa julooduhum bimaa kaanoo ya'maloon ^qTrans4019


till, when they come close to it, their hearing and their sight and their [very] skins will bear witness against them, speaking of what they were doing [on earth]. ^qAsad4019


Till, when they reach it, their ears and their eyes and their skins testify against them as to what they used to do. ^qPickthall4019


till when they are come to it, their hearing, their eyes and their skins bear witness against them concerning what they have been doing, ^qArberry4019

# 21

Wa qaaloo lijuloodihim lima shahittum 'alainaa qaaloo antaqanal laahul lazeee antaqa kulla shai'inw wa Huwa khalaqakum awwala marratinw wa ilaihi turja'oon ^qTrans4020


And they will ask their skins, “Why did you bear witness against us?” - [and] these will reply: “God, who gives speech to all things, has given speech to us [as well]: for He [it is who] has created you in the first instance - and unto Him you are [now] brought back. ^qAsad4020


And they say unto their skins: Why testify ye against us? They say: Allah hath given us speech Who giveth speech to all things, and Who created you at the first, and unto Whom ye are returned. ^qPickthall4020


and they will say to their skins, 'Why bore you witness against us?' They shall say, 'God gave us speech, as He gave everything speech. He created you the first time, and unto Him you shall be returned. ^qArberry4020

# 22

Wa maa kuntum tastatiroona ai-yashhada 'alaikum sam'ukum wa laaa absaarukum wa laa juloodukum wa laakin zanantum annal laaha laa ya'lamu kaseeram mimmaa ta'maloon ^qTrans4021


And you did not try to hide [your sins] lest your hearing or your sight or your skins bear witness against you: nay, but you thought that God did not know much of what you were doing – ^qAsad4021


Ye did not hide yourselves lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should testify against you, but ye deemed that Allah knew not much of what ye did. ^qPickthall4021


Not so did you cover yourselves, that your hearing, your eyes and your skins should not bear witness against you; but you thought that God would never know much of the things that you were working. ^qArberry4021

# 23

Wa zaalikum zannukumul lazee zanantum bi-Rabbikum ardaakum fa asbahtum minal khaasireen ^qTrans4022


and that very thought which you thought about your Sustainer has brought you to perdition, and so now you find yourselves among the lost!” ^qAsad4022


That, your thought which ye did think about your Lord, hath ruined you; and ye find yourselves (this day) among the lost. ^qPickthall4022


That then, the thought you thought about your Lord, has destroyed you, and therefore you find yourselves this morning among the losers.' ^qArberry4022

# 24

Fa-iny yasbiroo fan Naaru maswal lahum wa iny-yasta'tiboo famaa hum minal mu'tabeen ^qTrans4023


And then, [even] if they endure [their lot] in patience, the fire will still be their abode; and if they pray to be allowed to make amends, they will not be allowed to do so: ^qAsad4023


And though they are resigned, yet the Fire is still their home; and if they ask for favour, yet they are not of those unto whom favour can be shown. ^qPickthall4023


Then if they persist, the Fire shall be a lodging for them; and if they ask amends yet no amends shall be made to them. ^qArberry4023

# 25

Wa qaiyadnaa lahum quranaaa'a fazaiyanoo lahum maa baina aideehim wa maa khalfahum wa haqqa 'alaihimul qawlu feee umamin qad khalat min qablihim minal jinni wal insi innahum kaanoo khaasireen ^qTrans4024


for [when they became obli­vious of Us,] We assigned to them [their own evil impulses as their] other selves, and these made appear goodly to them whatever lay open before them and whatever was beyond their ken. And so, the sentence [of doom] will have fallen due upon them together with the [other sinful] com­munities of invisible beings and humans that passed away before their time: verily, they [all] will indeed be lost! ^qAsad4024


And We assigned them comrades (in the world), who made their present and their past fairseeming unto them. And the Word concerning nations of the jinn and humankind who passed away before them hath effect for them. Lo! they were ever losers. ^qPickthall4024


We have allotted them comrades, and they have decked out fair to them that which is before them and behind them. So against them has been realized the Word concerning nations that passed away before them, men and jinn alike; surely they were losers. ^qArberry4024

# 26

Wa qaalal lazeena kafaroo laa tasma'oo lihaazal Quraani walghaw feehi la'allakum taghlihoon ^qTrans4025


NOW THOSE who are bent on denying the truth say [unto one another]: “Do not listen to this Qur’an, but rather talk frivolously about it, so that you might gain the upper hand!” ^qAsad4025


Those who disbelieve say: Heed not this Qur'an, and drown the hearing of it; haply ye may conquer. ^qPickthall4025


The unbelievers say, 'Do not give ear to this Koran, and talk idly about it; haply you will overcome. ^qArberry4025

# 27

Falanuzeeqannal lazeena kafaroo 'azaaban shadeedanw wa lanajziyannahum aswallazee kaanoo ya'maloon ^qTrans4026


But We shall most certainly give those who are [thus] bent on denying the truth a taste of suffering severe, and We shall most certainly requite them according to the worst of their deeds! ^qAsad4026


But verily We shall cause those who disbelieve to taste an awful doom, and verily We shall requite them the worst of what they used to do. ^qPickthall4026


So We shall let the unbelievers taste a terrible chastisement, and shall recompense them with the worst of what they were working. ^qArberry4026

# 28

Zaalika jazaaa'u a'daaa'il laahin Naaru lahum feehaa daarul khuld, jazaaa'am bimaa kaanoo bi aayaatinaa yajhdoon ^qTrans4027


That requital of God’s enemies will be the fire [of the hereafter]: in it will they have an abode of immeasurable duration as an outcome of their having knowingly rejected Our messages. ^qAsad4027


That is the reward of Allah's enemies: the Fire. Therein is their immortal home, payment forasmuch as they denied Our revelations. ^qPickthall4027


That is the recompense of God's enemies -- the Fire, wherein they shall have the Abode of Eternity as a recompense, for that they denied Our signs. ^qArberry4027

# 29

Wa qaalal lazeena kafaroo Rabbanaaa arinal lazaini adal laanaa minal jinni wal insi naj'alhumaa tahta aqdaaminaa liyakoonaa minal asfaleen ^qTrans4028


And they who [in their life on earth] were bent on denying the truth will [thereupon] exclaim: “O our Sustainer! Show us those of the invisible beings and humans that have led us astray: we shall trample them underfoot, so that they shall be the lowest of all!” ^qAsad4028


And those who disbelieve will say: Our Lord! Show us those who beguiled us of the jinn and humankind. We will place them underneath our feet that they may be among the nethermost. ^qPickthall4028


And the unbelievers shall say, 'Our Lord, show us those that led us astray, both jinn and men, and we shall set them underneath our feet, that they may be among the lower ones. ^qArberry4028

[But,] behold, as for those who say, “Our Sustainer is God,” and then steadfastly pursue the right way - upon them do angels often descend, [say­ing:] “Fear not and grieve not, but receive the glad tiding of that paradise which has been promised to you! ^qAsad4029


Lo! those who say: Our Lord is Allah, and afterward are upright, the angels descend upon them, saying: Fear not nor grieve, but hear good tidings of the paradise which ye are promised. ^qPickthall4029


Those who have said, 'Our Lord is God.' then have gone straight, upon them the angels descend, saying, 'Fear not, neither sorrow; rejoice in Paradise that you were promised. ^qArberry4029

Nahnu awliyaaa'ukum fil hayaatid dunyaa wa fil Aakhirati wa lakum feehaa maa tashtaheee anfusukum wa lakum feehaa ma tadda'oon ^qTrans4030


We are close unto you in the life of this world and [will be so] in the life to come; and in that [life to come] you shall have all that your souls may desire, and in it you shall have all that you ever prayed for, ^qAsad4030


We are your protecting friends in the life of the world and in the Hereafter. There ye will have (all) that your souls desire, and there ye will have (all) for which ye pray. ^qPickthall4030


We are your friends in the present life and in the world to come; therein you shall have all that your souls desire, all that you call for, ^qArberry4030

# 32

Nuzulam min Ghafoorir Raheem ^qTrans4031


as a ready welcome from Him who is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace!” ^qAsad4031


A gift of welcome from One Forgiving, Merciful. ^qPickthall4031


as hospitality from One All-forgiving, One All-compassionate.' ^qArberry4031

# 33

Wa man ahsanu qawlam mimman da'aaa ilal laahi wa 'amila saalihanw wa qaala innanee minal muslimeen ^qTrans4032


And who could be better of speech than he who calls [his fellow-men] unto God, and does what is just and right, and says, “Verily, I am of those who have surrendered themselves to God”? ^qAsad4032


And who is better in speech than him who prayeth unto his Lord and doeth right, and saith: Lo! I am of those who are muslims (surrender unto Him). ^qPickthall4032


And who speaks fairer than he who calls unto God and does righteousness and says, 'Surely I am of them that surrender'? ^qArberry4032

# 34

Wa laa tastawil hasanatu wa las saiyi'ah; idfa' billatee hiya ahsanu fa'izal lazee bainaka wa bainahoo 'adaawatun ka'annahoo waliyun hameem ^qTrans4033


But [since] good and evil cannot be equal, repel thou [evil] with something that is better and lo! he between whom and thyself was enmity [may then become] as though he had [always] been close [unto thee], a true friend! ^qAsad4033


The good deed and the evil deed are not alike. Repel the evil deed with one which is better, then lo! he, between whom and thee there was enmity (will become) as though he was a bosom friend. ^qPickthall4033


Not equal are the good deed and the evil deed. Repel with that which is fairer and behold, he between whom and thee there is enmity shall be as if he were a loyal friend. ^qArberry4033

# 35

Wa maa yulaqqaahaaa illal lazeena sabaroo wa maa yulaqqaahaaa illaa zoo hazzin 'azeem ^qTrans4034


Yet [to achieve] this is not given to any but those who are wont to be patient in adversity: it is not given to any but those endowed with the greatest good fortune! ^qAsad4034


But none is granted it save those who are steadfast, and none is granted it save the owner of great happiness. ^qPickthall4034


Yet none shall receive it, except the steadfast; none shall receive it, except a man of mighty fortune. ^qArberry4034

# 36

Wa immaa yanzaghannaka minash Shaitaani nazghun fasta'iz billaahi innahoo Huwas Samee'ul 'Aleem ^qTrans4035


Hence, if it should happen that a prompting from Satan stirs thee up [to blind anger], seek refuge with God: behold, He alone is all-hearing, all-knowing! ^qAsad4035


And if a whisper from the devil reach thee (O Muhammad) then seek refuge in Allah. Lo! He is the Hearer, the Knower. ^qPickthall4035


If a provocation from Satan should provoke thee, seek refuge in God; He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing. ^qArberry4035

Now among His signs are the night and the day, as well as the sun and the moon: [hence,] adore not the sun or the moon, but prostrate yourselves in adoration before God, who has created them - if it is Him whom you [really] worship. ^qAsad4036


And of His portents are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun or the moon; but prostrate to Allah Who created them, if it is in truth Him Whom ye worship. ^qPickthall4036


And of His signs are the night and the day, the sun and the moon. Bow not yourselves to the sun and moon, but bow yourselves to God who created them, if Him you serve. ^qArberry4036

And though some be too proud [to listen to this call], they who [in their hearts] are with thy Sustainer extol His limitless glory by night and by day, and never grow weary [thereof]. ^qAsad4037


But if they are too proud - still those who are with thy Lord glorify Him night and day, and tire not. ^qPickthall4037


And if they wax proud, yet those who are with thy Lord do glorify Him by night and day, and grow not weary. ^qArberry4037

For among His signs is this: thou seest the earth lying desolate - and lo! when We send down water upon it, it stirs and swells [with life]! Verily, He who brings it to life can surely give life to the dead [of heart as well]: for, behold, He has the power to will anything. ^qAsad4038


And of His portents (is this): that thou seest the earth lowly, but when We send down water thereon it thrilleth and groweth. Lo! He Who quickeneth it is verily the Quickener of the Dead. Lo! He is Able to do all things. ^qPickthall4038


And of His signs is that thou seest the earth humble; then, when We send down water upon it, it quivers, and swells. Surely He who quickens it is He who quickens the dead; surely He is powerful over everything. ^qArberry4038

VERILY, they who distort the meaning of Our mes­sages are not hidden from Us: hence, which [of the two] will be in a better state - he that is [destined to be] cast into the fire, or he that shall come secure [before Us] on Resurrection Day? Do what you will: verily, He sees all that you do. ^qAsad4039


Lo! those who distort Our revelations are not hid from Us. Is he who is hurled into the Fire better, or he who cometh secure on the Day of Resurrection? Do what ye will. Lo! He is Seer of what ye do. ^qPickthall4039


Those who blaspheme Our signs are not hidden from Us. What, is he who shall be cast into the Fire better, or he who comes on the Day of Resurrection in security? Do what you will; surely He sees the things you do. ^qArberry4039

Verily, they who are bent on denying the truth of this reminder as soon as it comes to them - [they are the losers]: for, behold, it is a sublime divine writ: ^qAsad4040


Lo! those who disbelieve in the Reminder when it cometh unto them (are guilty), for lo! it is an unassailable Scripture. ^qPickthall4040


Those who disbelieve in the Remembrance when it comes to them -- and surely it is a Book Sublime; ^qArberry4040

no falsehood can ever attain to it openly, and neither in a stealthy manner, [since it is] bestowed from on high by One who is truly wise, ever to be praised. ^qAsad4041


Falsehood cannot come at it from before it or from behind it. (It is) a revelation from the Wise, the Owner of Praise. ^qPickthall4041


falsehood comes not to it from before it nor from behind it; a sending down from One All-wise, All-laudable. ^qArberry4041

Maa yuqaalu laka illaa maa qad qeela lir Rusuli min qablik; inna Rabbaka lazoo maghfiratinw wa zoo 'iqaabin aleem ^qTrans4042


[And as for thee, O Prophet,] nothing is being said to thee but what was said to all [of God’s] apostles before thy time. Behold, thy Sustainer is indeed full of forgiveness - but He has also the power to requite most grie­vously! ^qAsad4042


Naught is said unto thee (Muhammad) save what was said unto the messengers before thee. Lo! thy Lord is owner of forgiveness, and owner (also) of dire punishment. ^qPickthall4042


Naught is said to thee but what already was said to the Messengers before thee. Surely thy Lord is a Lord of forgiveness and of painful retribution. ^qArberry4042

Now if We had willed this [divine writ] to be a discourse in a non-Arabic tongue, they [who now reject it] would surely have said, “Why is it that its messages have not been spelled out clearly? Why - [a message in] a non-Arabic tongue, and [its bearer] an Arab?” Say: “Unto all who have attained to faith, this [divine writ] is a guidance and a source of health; but as for those who will not believe - in their ears is deafness, and so it remains obscure to them: they are [like people who are] being called from too far away. ^qAsad4043


And if We had appointed it a Lecture in a foreign tongue they would assuredly have said: If only its verses were expounded (so that we might understand)? What! A foreign tongue and an Arab? - Say unto them (O Muhammad): For those who believe it is a guidance and a healing; and as for those who disbelieve, there is a deafness in their ears, and it is blindness for them. Such are called to from afar. ^qPickthall4043


If We had made it a barbarous Koran, they would have said, 'Why are its signs not distinguished? What, barbarous and Arabic?' Say: 'To the believers it is a guidance, and a healing; but those who believe not, in their ears is a heaviness, and to them it is a blindness; those -- they are called from a far place.' ^qArberry4043

Thus, too, have We vouchsafed revelation unto Moses aforetime, and thereupon disputes arose about it. And [then, as now,] had it not been for a decree that had already gone forth from thy Sustainer, all would indeed have been decided between them [from the outset]. As it is, behold, they [who will not believe in this divine writ] are in grave doubt, amounting to suspicion, about what it portends. ^qAsad4044


And We verily gave Moses the Scripture, but there hath been dispute concerning it; and but for a Word that had already gone forth from thy Lord, it would ere now have been judged between them; but lo! they are in hopeless doubt concerning it. ^qPickthall4044


And We gave Moses the Book; and there was difference concerning it, and but for a Word that preceded from thy Lord, it had been decided between them; and they are in doubt of it disquieting. ^qArberry4044

WHOEVER does what is just and right, does so for his own good; and whoever does evil, does so to his own hurt: and never does God do the least wrong to His creatures. ^qAsad4045


Whoso doeth right it is for his soul, and whoso doeth wrong it is against it. And thy Lord is not at all a tyrant to His slaves. ^qPickthall4045


Whoso does righteousness, it is to his own gain, and whoso does evil, it is to his own loss. Thy Lord wrongs not His servants. ^qArberry4045

In Him alone is vested the knowledge of when the Last Hour will come. And no fruit bursts forth from its calyx, and no female ever conceives, nor ever gives birth, save with His knowledge. And so, on the Day when He shall call out to them, “Where, now, are those [alleged] partners of Mine?” - they will [surely] answer, “We confess unto Thee that none of us can bear witness [to anyone’s having a share in Thy divinity]!” ^qAsad4046


Unto Him is referred (all) knowledge of the Hour. And no fruits burst forth from their sheaths, and no female carrieth or bringeth forth but with His knowledge. And on the day when He calleth unto them: Where are now My partners? they will say: We confess unto Thee, not one of us is a witness (for them). ^qPickthall4046


To Him is referred the knowledge of the Hour. Not a fruit comes forth from its sheath, no female bears or brings forth, save with His knowledge. Upon the day when He shall call to them, 'Where now are My associates?' they shall say, 'We proclaim to Thee, there is not a witness among us. ^qArberry4046

And so, all that they were wont to invoke aforetime will have forsaken them; and they shall know for certain that there is no escape for them. ^qAsad4047


And those to whom they used to cry of old have failed them, and they perceive they have no place of refuge. ^qPickthall4047


Then that they called upon before will go astray from them and they will think that they have no asylum. ^qArberry4047

MAN NEVER TIRES of asking for the good [things of life]; and if evil fortune touches him, he abandons all hope, giving himself up to despair. ^qAsad4048


Man tireth not of praying for good, and if ill toucheth him, then he is disheartened, desperate. ^qPickthall4048


Man wearies not of praying for good; but when evil visits him, then he is cast down and desperate. ^qArberry4048

Yet whenever We let him taste some of Our grace after hardship has visited him, he is sure to say, “This is but my due!” - and, “I do not think that the Last Hour will ever come: but if [it should come, and] I should indeed be brought back unto my Sus­tainer, then, behold, the ultimate good awaits me with Him! But [on the Day of Judgment] We shall most cer­tainly give those who were bent on denying the truth full understanding of all that they ever did, and shall most certainly give them [thereby] a taste of suffering severe. ^qAsad4049


And verily, if We cause him to taste mercy after some hurt that hath touched him, he will say: This is my own; and I deem not that the Hour will ever rise, and if I am brought back to my Lord, I surely shall be better off with Him - But We verily shall tell those who disbelieve (all) that they did, and We verily shall make them taste hard punishment. ^qPickthall4049


And if We let him taste mercy from Us after hardship that has visited him, he surely says, 'This is mine; I think not the Hour is coming. If I am returned to my Lord, surely the reward most fair with Him will be mine.' Then We shall tell the unbelievers the things they have done, and assuredly We shall let them taste a harsh chastisement. ^qArberry4049

And, too, when We bestow Our blessings upon man, he tends to turn aside and keep aloof [from remembering Us]; but as soon as evil fortune touches him, he is full of wordy prayers! ^qAsad4050


When We show favour unto man, he withdraweth and turneth aside, but when ill toucheth him then he aboundeth in prayer. ^qPickthall4050


And when We bless man, he turns away and withdraws aside; but when evil visits him, he is full of endless prayers. ^qArberry4050

HAVE YOU given thought [to how you will fare] if this be truly [a revelation] from God, the while you deny its truth? Who could be more astray than one who places himself [so] deeply in the wrong? ^qAsad4051


Bethink you: If it is from Allah and ye reject it - Who is further astray than one who is at open feud (with Allah)? ^qPickthall4051

In time We shall make them fully understand Our messages [through what they perceive] in the utmost horizons [of the universe] and within them­selves, so that it will become clear unto them that this [revelation] is indeed the truth. [Still,] is it not enough [for them to know] that thy Sustainer is witness unto everything? ^qAsad4052


We shall show them Our portents on the horizons and within themselves until it will be manifest unto them that it is the Truth. Doth not thy Lord suffice, since He is Witness over all things? ^qPickthall4052


We shall show them Our signs in the horizons and in themselves, till it is clear to them that it is the truth. Suffices it not as to thy Lord, that He is witness over everything? ^qArberry4052
