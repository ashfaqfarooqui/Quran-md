Alhamdu lillaahi faatiris samaawaati wal ardi jaa'ilil malaaa'ikati rusulan uleee ajnihatim masnaa wa sulaasa wa rubaa'; yazeedu fil khalqi maa yashaaa'; innal laaha 'alaa kulli shai'in Qadeer ^qTrans340


ALL PRAISE is due to God, Originator of the heavens and the earth, who causes the angels to be (His) message-bearers, endowed with wings, two, or three, or four. [Unceasingly] He adds to His creation whatever He wills: for, verily, God has the power to will anything. ^qAsad340


Praise be to Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, Who appointeth the angels messengers having wings two, three and four. He multiplieth in creation what He will. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things. ^qPickthall340


Praise belongs to God, Originator of the heavens and earth, who appointed the angels to be messengers having wings two, three and four, increasing creation as He wills. Surely God is powerful over everything. ^qArberry340

Maa yaftahil laahu linnaaasi mir rahmatin falaa mumsika lahaa wa maa yumsik falaa mursila lahoo mimb'dih; wa Huwal 'Azeezul Hakeem ^qTrans341


Whatever grace God opens up to man, none can withhold it; and whatever He withholds, none can henceforth release: for He alone is almighty, truly wise. ^qAsad341


That which Allah openeth unto mankind of mercy none can withhold it; and that which He withholdeth none can release thereafter. He is the Mighty, the Wise. ^qPickthall341


Whatsoever mercy God opens to men, none can withhold and whatsoever He withholds, none can loose after Him. He is the All-mighty, the All-wise. ^qArberry341

O men! Call to mind the blessings which God has bestowed upon you! Is there any creator, other than God, that could provide for you sustenance out of heaven and earth? There is no deity save Him: and yet, how perverted are your minds! ^qAsad342


O mankind! Remember Allah's grace toward you! Is there any creator other than Allah who provideth for you from the sky and the earth? There is no Allah save Him. Whither then are ye turned? ^qPickthall342


O men, remember God's blessing upon you; is there any creator, apart from God, who provides for you out of heaven and earth? There is no god but He: how then are you perverted? ^qArberry342

Wa iny yukazzibooka faqad kuzzibat Rusulum min qablik; wa ilal laahi turja'ul umoor ^qTrans343


But if they [whose minds are perverted] give thee the lie, [O Prophet, remember that] even so, before thy time, have [other] apostles been given the lie: for [the unbelievers always refuse to admit that] all things go back to God [as their source]. ^qAsad343


And if they deny thee, (O Muhammad), messengers (of Allah) were denied before thee. Unto Allah all things are brought back. ^qPickthall343


If they cry lies to thee, Messengers before thee were cried lies to; and unto God all matters are returned. ^qArberry343

Yaaa ayyuhan naasu inna wa'dal laahi haqqun falaa taghurrannakumul hayaatud dunyaa; wa laa yaghurran nakum billaahil gharoor ^qTrans344


O men! Verily, God’s promise [of resurrection] is true indeed: let not, then, the life of this world delude you, and let not [your own] deceptive thoughts about God delude you! ^qAsad344


O mankind! Lo! the promise of Allah is true. So let not the life of the world beguile you, and let not the (avowed) beguiler beguile you with regard to Allah. ^qPickthall344


O men, God's promise is true; so let not the present life delude you, and let not the Deluder delude you concerning God. ^qArberry344

Innash shaitaana lakum 'aduwwun fattakhizoohu 'aduwwaa; innamaa yad'oo hizbahoo liyakoonoo min ashaabis sa'eer ^qTrans345


Behold, Satan is a foe unto you: so treat him as a foe. He but calls on his followers to the end that they might find themselves among such as are des­tined for the blazing flame – ^qAsad345


Lo! the devil is an enemy for you, so treat him as an enemy. He only summoneth his faction to be owners of the flaming Fire. ^qPickthall345


Surely Satan is an enemy to you; so take him for an enemy. He calls his party only that they may be among the inhabitants of the Blaze. ^qArberry345

Allazeena kafaroo lahum 'azaabun shadeed; wallazeena aamanoo wa 'amilus saalihaati lahum maghfiratunw wa ajrun kabeer ^qTrans346


[seeing that] for those who are bent on denying the truth there is suffering severe in store, just as for those who have attained to faith and do righteous deeds there is forgiveness of sins, and a great reward. ^qAsad346


Those who disbelieve, theirs will be an awful doom; and those who believe and do good works, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward. ^qPickthall346


Those who disbelieve -- there awaits them a terrible chastisement; but those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness -- theirs shall be forgiveness and a great wage. ^qArberry346

Is, then, he to whom the evil of his own doings is [so] alluring that [in the end] he regards it as good [anything but a follower of Satan]? For, verily, God lets go astray him that wills [to go astray], just as He guides him that wills [to be guided]. Hence, [O believer,] do not waste thyself in sorrowing over them: verily, God has full knowledge of all that they do! ^qAsad347


Is he, the evil of whose deeds is made fairseeming unto him so that he deemeth it good, (other than Satan's dupe)? Allah verily sendeth whom He will astray, and guideth whom He will; so let not thy soul expire in sighings for them. Lo! Allah is Aware of what they do! ^qPickthall347


And what of him, the evil of whose deeds has been decked out fair to him, so that he thinks it is good? God leads astray whomsoever He will, and whomsoever He will He guides; so let not thy soul be wasted in regrets for them; God has knowledge of the things they work. ^qArberry347

Wallaahul lazeee arsalar riyaaha fatuseeru shaaban fasuqnaahu ilaa baladim maiyitin fa ahyaynaa bihil arda ba'da mawtihaa; kazaalikan nushoor ^qTrans348


AND [remember:] it is God who sends forth the winds, so that they raise a cloud, whereupon We drive it towards dead land and thereby give life to the earth after it had been lifeless: even thus shall resur­rection be! ^qAsad348


And Allah it is Who sendeth the winds and they raise a cloud; then We lead it unto a dead land and revive therewith the earth after its death. Such is the Resurrection. ^qPickthall348


God is He that looses the winds, that stir up cloud, then We drive it to a dead land and therewith revive the earth, after it is dead. Even so is the Uprising. ^qArberry348

He who desires might and glory [ought to know that] all might and glory belong to God [alone]. Unto Him ascend all good words, and the righteous deed does He exalt. But as for those who cunningly devise evil deeds - suffering severe awaits them; and all their devising is bound to come to nought. ^qAsad349


Whoso desireth power (should know that) all power belongeth to Allah. Unto Him good words ascend, and the pious deed doth He exalt; but those who plot iniquities, theirs will be an awful doom; and the plotting of such (folk) will come to naught. ^qPickthall349


Whosoever desires glory, the glory altogether belongs to God. To Him good words go up, and the righteous deed -- He uplifts it; but those who devise evil deeds -- theirs shall be a terrible chastisement, and their devising shall come to naught. ^qArberry349

And [remember:] God creates [every one of] you out of dust, then out of a drop of sperm; and then He fashions you into either of the two sexes. And no female conceives or gives birth unless it be with His knowledge; and none that is long-lived has his days lengthened - and neither is aught lessened of his days - unless it be thus laid down in [God’s] decree: for, behold, all this is easy for God. ^qAsad3410


Allah created you from dust, then from a little fluid, then He made you pairs (the male and female). No female beareth or bringeth forth save with His knowledge. And no-one groweth old who groweth old, nor is aught lessened of his life, but it is recorded in a Book, Lo! that is easy for Allah. ^qPickthall3410


God created you of dust then of a sperm-drop, then He made you pairs. No female bears or brings forth, save with His knowledge; and none is given long life who is given long life neither is any diminished in his life, but it is in a Book. Surely that is easy for God. ^qArberry3410

Wa maa yastawil bahraani haaza 'azbun furaatun saaa'ighun sharaabuhoo wa haazaa milhun ujaaj; wa min kullin taakuloona lahman tariyyanw wa tastakhrijoona hilyatan talbasoonahaa wa taral fulka feehi mawaakhira litabtaghoo min fadlihee wa la'allakm tashkuroon ^qTrans3411


[Easy is it for Him to create likeness and variety:] thus, the two great bodies of water [on earth] are not alike the one sweet, thirst-allaying, pleasant to drink, and the other salty and bitter: and yet, from either of them do you eat fresh meat, and [from either] you take gems which you may wear; and on either thou canst see ships ploughing through the waves, so that you might [be able to] go forth in quest of some of His bounty, and thus have cause to be grateful. ^qAsad3411


And the two seas are not alike: this, fresh, sweet, good to drink, this (other) bitter, salt. And from them both ye eat fresh meat and derive the ornament that ye wear. And thou seest the ship cleaving them with its prow that ye may seek of His bounty, and that haply ye may give thanks. ^qPickthall3411


Not equal are the two seas; this is sweet, grateful to taste, delicious to drink, and that is salt, bitter to the tongue. Yet of both you eat fresh flesh, and bring forth out of it ornaments for you to wear; and thou mayest see the ships cleaving through it, that you may seek of His bounty, and so haply you will be thankful. ^qArberry3411

Yoolijul laila fin nahaari wa yoolijun nahaara fil laili wa sakhkharash shamsa wal qamara kulluny yajree li ajalim musammaa; zaalikumul lahuu Rabbukum lahul mulk; wallazeena tad'oona min doonihee maa yamlikoona min qitmeer ^qTrans3412


He makes the night grow longer by shortening the day, and He makes the day grow longer by shortening the night; and He has made the sun and the moon subservient [to His laws], each running its course for a term set [by Him]. Thus is God, your Sustainer: unto Him belongs all dominion - whereas those whom you invoke instead of Him do not own so much as the husk of a date-stone! ^qAsad3412


He maketh the night to pass into the day and He maketh the day to pass into the night. He hath subdued the sun and moon to service. Each runneth unto an appointed term. Such is Allah, your Lord; His is the Sovereignty; and those unto whom ye pray instead of Him own not so much as the white spot on a date-stone. ^qPickthall3412


He makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night, and He has subjected the sun and the moon, each of them running to a stated term. That is God, your Lord; to Him belongs the Kingdom; and those you call upon, apart from Him, possess not so much as the skin of a date-stone. ^qArberry3412

If you invoke them, they do not hear your call; and even if they could hear, they would not [be able to] respond to you. And [withal,] on the Day of Resurrection they will utterly disown your having associated them with God. And none can make thee understand [the truth] like the One who is all-aware. ^qAsad3413


If ye pray unto them they hear not your prayer, and if they heard they could not grant it you. On the Day of Resurrection they will disown association with you. None can inform you like Him Who is Aware. ^qPickthall3413


If you call upon them, they will not hear your prayer, and if they heard, they would not answer you; and on the Day of Resurrection they will disown your partnership. None can tell thee like One who is aware. ^qArberry3413

# 15

Yaaa ayyunhan naasu antumul fuqaraaa'u ilallaahi wallaahu Huwal Ghaniyyul Hameed ^qTrans3414


O men! It is you, who stand in need of God, whereas He alone is self-sufficient, the One to whom all praise is due. ^qAsad3414


O mankind! Ye are the poor in your relation to Allah. And Allah! He is the Absolute, the Owner of Praise. ^qPickthall3414


O men, you are the ones that have need of God; He is the All-sufficient, the All-laudable. ^qArberry3414

# 16

Iny yashaa yuzhibkum wa yaati bikhalqin jadeed ^qTrans3415


If He so wills, He can do away with you and bring forth a new mankind [in your stead]: ^qAsad3415


If He will, He can be rid of you and bring (instead of you) some new creation. ^qPickthall3415


If He will, He can put you away and bring a new creation; ^qArberry3415

# 17

Wa maa zaalika 'alal laahi bi'azeez ^qTrans3416


nor is this difficult for God. ^qAsad3416


That is not a hard thing for Allah. ^qPickthall3416


that is surely no great matter for God. ^qArberry3416

AND NO BEARER of burdens shall be made to bear another’s burden; and if one weighed down by his load calls upon [another] to help him carry it, nothing thereof may be carried [by that other], even if it be one’s near of kin. Hence, thou canst [truly] warn only those who stand in awe of their Sustainer although He is beyond the reach of their perception, and are constant in prayer, and [know that] whoever grows in purity, attains to purity but for the good of his own self, and [that] with God is all journeys’ end. ^qAsad3417


And no burdened soul can bear another's burden, and if one heavy laden crieth for (help with) his load, naught of it will be lifted even though he (unto whom he crieth) be of kin. Thou warnest only those who fear their Lord in secret, and have established worship. He who groweth (in goodness), groweth only for himself, (he cannot by his merit redeem others). Unto Allah is the journeying. ^qPickthall3417


No soul laden bears the load of another; and if one heavy-burdened calls for its load to be carried, not a thing of it will be carried, though he be a near kinsman. Thou warnest only those who fear their Lord in the Unseen and perform the prayer; and whosoever purifies himself, purifies himself only for his own soul's good. To God is the homecoming. ^qArberry3417

# 19

Wa maa tastawil a'maa wal baseer ^qTrans3418


For [thus it is:] the blind and the seeing are not equal; ^qAsad3418


The blind man is not equal with the seer; ^qPickthall3418


Not equal are the blind and the seeing man, ^qArberry3418

# 20

Wa laz zulumaatu wa lannoon ^qTrans3419

the shadows and the light, ^qArberry3419

# 21

Wa laz zillu wa lal haroor ^qTrans3420

Wa maa yastawil ahyaaa'u wa lal amwaat; innal laaha yusmi'u mai yashaaa'u wa maaa anta bimusi'im man fil quboor ^qTrans3421


and neither are equal the living and the dead [of heart]. Behold, [O Muhammad,] God can make hear whomever He wills, whereas thou canst not make hear such as are [dead of heart like the dead] in their graves: ^qAsad3421


Nor are the living equal with the dead. Lo! Allah maketh whom He will to hear. Thou canst not reach those who are in the graves. ^qPickthall3421


not equal are the living and the dead. God makes to hear whomsoever He will; thou canst not make those in their tombs to hear - ^qArberry3421

thou art naught but a warner. ^qArberry3422

Innaa arsalnaak bil haqqi basheeranw wa nazeeraa; wa im min ummatin illaa khalaa feehaa nazeer ^qTrans3423


Verily, We have sent thee with the truth, as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner: for there never was any community but a warner has [lived and] passed away in its midst. ^qAsad3423


Lo! We have sent thee with the Truth, a bearer of glad tidings and a warner; and there is not a nation but a warner hath passed among them. ^qPickthall3423


Surely We have sent thee with the truth good tidings to bear, and warning; not a nation there is, but there has passed away in it a warner. ^qArberry3423

And if they give thee the lie - even so gave the lie to the truth [many of] those who lived before their time, [when] there came unto them their apostles with all evidence of the truth, and with books of divine wisdom, and with light-giving revelation; ^qAsad3424


And if they deny thee, those before them also denied. Their messengers came unto them with clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty), and with the Psalms and the Scripture giving light. ^qPickthall3424


If they cry thee lies, those before them also cried lies; their Messengers came to them with the clear signs, the Psalms, the Illuminating Book; ^qArberry3424

Then seized I those who disbelieved, and how intense was My abhorrence! ^qPickthall3425


then I seized the unbelievers, and how was My horror! ^qArberry3425

ART THOU NOT aware that God sends down water from the skies, whereby We bring forth fruits of many hues - just as in the mountains there are streaks of white and red of various shades, as well as (others) raven-black, ^qAsad3426


Hast thou not seen that Allah causeth water to fall from the sky, and We produce therewith fruit of divers hues; and among the hills are streaks white and red, of divers hues, and (others) raven-black; ^qPickthall3426


Hast thou not seen how that God sends down out of heaven water, and therewith We bring forth fruits of diverse hues? And in the mountains are streaks white and red, of diverse hues, and pitchy black; ^qArberry3426

and (as) there are in men, and in crawling beasts, and in cattle, too, many hues? Of all His servants, only such as are endowed with [innate] knowledge stand [truly] in awe of God: [for they alone comprehend that,] verily, God is almighty, much-forgiving. ^qAsad3427


And of men and beasts and cattle, in like manner, divers hues? The erudite among His bondmen fear Allah alone. Lo! Allah is Mighty, Forgiving. ^qPickthall3427


men too, and beasts and cattle -- diverse are their hues. Even so only those of His servants fear God who have knowledge; surely God is All-mighty, All-forgiving. ^qArberry3427

Lo! those who read the Scripture of Allah, and establish worship, and spend of that which We have bestowed on them secretly and openly, they look forward to imperishable gain, ^qPickthall3428


Surely those who recite the Book of God and perform the prayer, and expend of that We have provided them, secretly and in public, look for a commerce that comes not to naught, ^qArberry3428

That He will pay them their wages and increase them of His grace. Lo! He is Forgiving, Responsive. ^qPickthall3429

And [know that] all of the divine writ with which We have inspired thee is the very truth, confirming the truth of whatever there still remains of earlier revelations for, behold, of [the needs of] His servants God is fully aware, all-seeing. ^qAsad3430


As for that which We inspire in thee of the Scripture, it is the Truth confirming that which was (revealed) before it. Lo! Allah is indeed Observer, Seer of His slaves. ^qPickthall3430


And that We have revealed to thee of the Book is the truth, confirming what is before it; God is aware of and sees His servants. ^qArberry3430

And so, We have bestowed this divine writ as a heritage unto such of Our servants as We chose: and among them are some who sin against themselves; and some who keep half-way [between right and wrong]; and some who, by God’s leave, are fore­most in deeds of goodness: [and] this, indeed, is a merit most high! ^qAsad3431


Then We gave the Scripture as inheritance unto those whom We elected of Our bondmen. But of them are some who wrong themselves and of them are some who are lukewarm, and of them are some who outstrip (others) through good deeds, by Allah's leave. That is the great favour! ^qPickthall3431


Then We bequeathed the Book on those of Our servants We chose; but of them some wrong themselves, some of them are lukewarm, and some are outstrippers in good works by the leave of God; that is the great bounty. ^qArberry3431

He who, out of His bounty, has made us alight in this abode of life enduring, wherein no struggle can assail us, and wherein no weariness can touch us!” ^qAsad3434


Who, of His grace, hath installed us in the mansion of eternity, where toil toucheth us not nor can weariness affect us. ^qPickthall3434


who of His bounty has made us to dwell in the abode of everlasting life wherein no weariness assails us neither fatigue.' ^qArberry3434

Wallazeena kafaroo lahum naaru Jahannama laa yuqdaa 'alaihim fa yamootoo wa laa yukhaffafu 'anhum min 'azaabihaa; kazaalika najzee kulla kafoor ^qTrans3435


But as for those who are bent on denying the truth - the fire of hell awaits them: no end shall be put to their lives so that they could die, nor shall aught of the suffering caused by that [fire] be lightened for them: thus shall We requite all who are bereft of gratitude. ^qAsad3435


But as for those who disbelieve, for them is fire of hell; it taketh not complete effect upon them so that they can die, nor is its torment lightened for them. Thus We punish every ingrate. ^qPickthall3435


As for the unbelievers, theirs shall be the fire of Gehenna; they shall neither be done with and die, nor shall its chastisement be lightened for them. Even so We recompense every ungrateful one. ^qArberry3435

Wa hum yastarikhoona feehaa Rabbanaa akhrijnaa na'mal saalihan ghairal lazee kunnaa na'mal; awa lamnu 'ammirkum maa yatazak karu feehi man tazakkara wa jaaa'akumun nazeeru fazooqoo famaa lizzaalimeena min naseer ^qTrans3436


And in that [hell] they will cry aloud: “O our Sustainer! Cause us to come out [of this suffering]! We shall [henceforth] do good deeds, not such as we were wont to do [aforetime]!” [But We shall answer:] “Did We not grant you a life long enough so that whoever was willing to take thought could bethink himself? And [withal,] a war­ner had come unto you! Taste, then, [the fruit of your evil deeds]: for evildoers shall have none to succour them!” ^qAsad3436


And they cry for help there, (saying): Our Lord! Release us; we will do right, not (the wrong) that we used to do. Did not We grant you a life long enough for him who reflected to reflect therein? And the warner came unto you. Now taste (the flavour of your deeds), for evil-doers have no helper. ^qPickthall3436


Therein they shall shout, 'Our Lord, bring us forth, and we will do righteousness, other than what we have done.' 'What, did We not give you long life, enough to remember in for him who would remember? To you the warner came; taste you now! The evildoers shall have no helper.' ^qArberry3436

Innal laaha 'aalimu ghaibis samaawaati wal ard; innahoo 'aleemum bizaatis sudoor ^qTrans3437


Verily, God knows the hidden reality of the heavens and the earth: [and,] behold, He has full knowledge of what is in the hearts [of men]. ^qAsad3437


Lo! Allah is the Knower of the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. Lo! He is Aware of the secret of (men's) breasts. ^qPickthall3437


God knows the Unseen in the heavens and the earth; He knows the thoughts within the breasts. ^qArberry3437

Huwal lazee ja'alakum khalaaa'ifa fil ard; faman kafara fa'alaihi kufruhoo; wa laa yazeedul kaafireena kufruhum 'inda Rabbihim illaa maqtanw wa la yazeedul kaafireena kufruhum illaa khasaaraa ^qTrans3438


He it is who has made you inherit the earth. Hence, he who is bent on denying the truth [of God’s oneness and uniqueness ought to know that] this denial of his will fall back upon him: for their [per­sistent] denial of this truth does but add to the deniers’ loathsomeness in their Sustainer’s sight and, thus, their denial of this truth does but add to the deniers’ loss. ^qAsad3438


He it is Who hath made you regents in the earth; so he who disbelieveth, his disbelief be on his own head. Their disbelief increaseth for the disbelievers, in their Lord's sight, naught save abhorrence. Their disbelief increaseth for the disbelievers naught save loss. ^qPickthall3438


It is He who appointed you viceroys in the earth. So whosoever disbelieves, his unbelief shall be charged against him; their unbelief increases the disbelievers only in hate in God's sight; their unbelief increases the disbelievers only in loss. ^qArberry3438

Say: “Have you ever [really] considered those beings and forces to whom you ascribe a share in God’s divinity, [and] whom you invoke beside God? Show me what it is that they have created on earth - or do [you claim that] they have a share in [govern­ing] the heavens?” Have We ever vouchsafed them a divine writ on which they could rely as evidence [in support of their views]? Nay, [the hope which] the evildoers hold out to one another [is] nothing but a delusion. ^qAsad3439


Say: Have ye seen your partner-gods to whom ye pray beside Allah? Show me what they created of the earth! Or have they any portion in the heavens? Or have We given them a scripture so they act on clear proof therefrom? Nay, the evil-doers promise one another only to deceive. ^qPickthall3439


Say: 'Have you considered your associates on whom you call, apart from God? Show me what they have created in the earth; or have they a partnership in the heavens?' Or have We given them a Book, so that they are upon a clear sign from it? Nay, but the evildoers promise one another naught but delusion. ^qArberry3439

Innal laaha yumsikus samaawaati wal arda an tazoolaaa; wa la'in zaalataaa in amsa kahumaa min ahadim mim ba'dih; innahoo kaana Haleeman Ghafooraa ^qTrans3440


Verily, it is God [alone] who upholds the celestial bodies and the earth, lest they deviate [from their orbits] - for if they should ever deviate, there is none that could uphold them after He will have ceased to do so. [But,] verily, He is ever-forbearing, much-for­giving! ^qAsad3440


Lo! Allah graspeth the heavens and the earth that they deviate not, and if they were to deviate there is not one that could grasp them after Him. Lo! He is ever Clement, Forgiving. ^qPickthall3440


God holds the heavens and the earth, lest they remove; did they remove, none would hold them after Him. Surely He is All-clement, All-forgiving. ^qArberry3440

As it is, they [who are averse to the truth often] swear by God with their most solemn oaths that if a warner should ever come to them, they would follow his guidance better than any of the communities [of old had followed the warner sent to them]: but now that a warner has come unto them, [his call] but increases their aversion, ^qAsad3441


And they swore by Allah, their most binding oath, that if a warner came unto them they would be more tractable than any of the nations; yet, when a warner came unto them it aroused in them naught save repugnance, ^qPickthall3441


They have sworn by God the most earnest oaths that if a warner came to them, they would be more rightly guided than any one of the nations; but when a warner came to them, it increased them only in aversion, ^qArberry3441

their arro­gant behaviour on earth, and their devising of evil [arguments against God’s messages]. Yet [in the end,] such evil scheming will engulf none but its authors: and can they expect anything but [to be made to go] the way of those [sinners] of olden times? Thus [it is]: no change wilt thou ever find in God’s way; yea, no deviation wilt thou ever find in God’s way! ^qAsad3442


(Shown in their) behaving arrogantly in the land and plotting evil; and the evil plot encloseth but the men who make it. Then, can they expect aught save the treatment of the folk of old? Thou wilt not find for Allah's way of treatment any substitute, nor wilt thou find for Allah's way of treatment aught of power to change. ^qPickthall3442


waxing proud in the land, and devising evil; but evil devising encompasses only those who do it; So do they expect anything but the wont of the ancients? And thou shalt never find any changing the Wont of God, and thou shalt never find any altering the wont of God. ^qArberry3442

Have they never journeyed about the earth and beheld what happened in the end to those [deniers of the truth] who lived before their time and were [so much] greater than they in power? And [do they not see that the will of] God can never be foiled by anything whatever in the heavens or on earth, since, verily, He is all-knowing, infinite in His power? ^qAsad3443


Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them, and they were mightier than these in power? Allah is not such that aught in the heavens or in the earth escapeth Him. Lo! He is the Wise, the Mighty. ^qPickthall3443


What, have they not journeyed in the land and beheld how was the end of those before them? They were stronger than themselves in might; but God -- there is naught in the heavens or the earth that can frustrate Him. Surely He is All-knowing, All-powerful. ^qArberry3443

Now if God were to take men [at once] to task for whatever [wrong] they commit [on earth], He would not leave a single living creature upon its surface. However, He grants them respite for a term set [by Him]: but when their term comes to an end - then, verily, [they come to know that] God sees all that is in [the hearts of] His servants. ^qAsad3444


If Allah took mankind to task by that which they deserve, He would not leave a living creature on the surface of the earth; but He reprieveth them unto an appointed term, and when their term cometh - then verily (they will know that) Allah is ever Seer of His slaves. ^qPickthall3444


If God should take men to task for what they have earned He would not leave upon the face of the earth one creature that crawls; but He is deferring them to a stated term. But when their term is come -- surely God sees His servants. ^qArberry3444
