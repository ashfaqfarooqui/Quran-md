Alif-Laaam-Raa; tilka Aayaatul Kitaabi wa Qur-aa-nim Mubeen ^qTrans151


Alif. Lam. Ra. THESE ARE MESSAGES of revelation -of a discourse clear in itself and clearly showing the truth. ^qAsad151


Alif. Lam. Ra. These are verses of the Scripture and a plain Reading. ^qPickthall151

# 2

Rubamaa yawaddul lazeena kafaroo law kaanoo muslimeen ^qTrans152


And it will come to pass that those who are [now] bent on denying this truth will wish that they had surrendered themselves to God [in their life time]. ^qAsad152


It may be that those who disbelieve wish ardently that they were Muslims. ^qPickthall152


Perchance the unbelievers will wish that they had surrendered: ^qArberry152

# 3

Zarhum yaakuloo wa tatamatta'oo wa yulhihimul amalu fasawfa ya'lamoon ^qTrans153


Leave them alone; let them eat and enjoy themselves the while the hope [of vain delights] be guiles them: for in time they will come to know [the truth]. ^qAsad153


Let them eat and enjoy life, and let (false) hope beguile them. They will come to know! ^qPickthall153


leave them to eat, and to take their joy, and to be bemused by hope; certainly they will soon know! ^qArberry153

# 4

Wa maaa ahlaknaa min qaryatin illaa wa lahaa kitaabum ma'loom ^qTrans154


And never have We destroyed any community [for its wrongdoing] unless a divine writ had (previously] been made known to it; ^qAsad154


And We destroyed no township but there was a known decree for it. ^qPickthall154


Never a city have We destroyed, but it had a known decree, ^qArberry154

# 5

Maa tasbiqu min ummatin ajalahaa wa maa yastaakhiroon ^qTrans155


[but remember that] no community can ever forestall [the end of] its term - and neither can they delay [it]. ^qAsad155


No nation can outstrip its term nor can they lag behind. ^qPickthall155


and no nation outstrips its term, nor do they put it back. ^qArberry155

# 6

Wa qaaloo yaaa aiyuhal lazee nuzzila 'alaihiz Zikru innaka lamajnoon ^qTrans156

And they say: O thou unto whom the Reminder is revealed, lo! thou art indeed a madman! ^qPickthall156


They say: 'Thou, upon whom the Remembrance is sent down, thou art assuredly possessed! ^qArberry156

# 7

Law maa taateenaa bil malaaa'ikati in kunta minas saadiqeen ^qTrans157


Why dost thou not bring before us angels, if thou art a man of truth? ^qAsad157


Why bringest thou not angels unto us, if thou art of the truthful? ^qPickthall157


Why dost thou not bring the angels unto us, if thou speakest truly?' ^qArberry157

# 8

Maa nunazzilul malaaa'i kata illaa bilhaqqi wa maa kaanooo izam munzareen ^qTrans158


[Yet] We never send down angels otherwise than in accordance with the [demands of] truth; and [were the angels to appear now,] lo! they [who reject this divine writ] would have no further respite! ^qAsad158


We send not down the angels save with the Fact, and in that case (the disbelievers) would not be tolerated. ^qPickthall158


We send not down the angels, save with truth; ^qArberry158

# 9

Innaa Nahnu nazalnaz Zikra wa Innaa lahoo lahaa fizoon ^qTrans159


Behold, it is We Ourselves who have bestowed from on high, step by step, this reminder? and, behold, it is We who shall truly guard it [from all corruption]. ^qAsad159


Lo! We, even We, reveal the Reminder, and lo! We verily are its Guardian. ^qPickthall159


then they would not be respited. It is We who have sent down the Remembrance, and We watch over it. ^qArberry159

# 10

Wa laqad arsalnaa min qablika fee shiya'il awwaleen ^qTrans1510


AND, INDEED, [O Prophet,] even before thy time did We send [Our apostles] unto communities of old - ^qAsad1510


We verily sent (messengers) before thee among the factions of the men of old. ^qPickthall1510


Indeed, We sent Messengers before thee, among the factions of the ancients, ^qArberry1510

# 11

Wa maa yaateehim mir Rasoolin illaa kaanoo bihee yastahzi'oon ^qTrans1511


and never yet came an apostle to them without their deriding him. ^qAsad1511


And never came there unto them a messenger but they did mock him. ^qPickthall1511


and not a single Messenger came to them, but they mocked at him; ^qArberry1511

# 12

kazaalika naslukuhoo fee quloobil mujrimeen ^qTrans1512


Even so do We [now] cause this [scorn of Our message] to pervade the hearts of those who are lost in sin, ^qAsad1512


Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty: ^qPickthall1512


even so We cause it to enter into the hearts of the sinners -- ^qArberry1512

# 13

Laa yu'minoona bihee wa qad khalat sunnatul awwaleen ^qTrans1513


who do not believe in it, although the way which those [evildoers] of olden times had to go has long been within their ken. ^qAsad1513


They believe not therein, though the example of the men of old hath gone before. ^qPickthall1513

# 14

Wa law fatahnaa 'alaihim baabam minas samaaa'i fazaloo feehi ya'rujoon ^qTrans1514


Yet even had We opened to them a gateway to heaven and they had ascended, on and on, up to it, ^qAsad1514


And even if We opened unto them a gate of heaven and they kept mounting through it, ^qPickthall1514


Though We opened to them a gate in heaven, and still they mounted through it, ^qArberry1514

# 15

Laqaaloo innamaa sukkirat absaarunaa bal nahnu qawmum mashooroon ^qTrans1515


they would surely have said, "It is only our eyes that are spellbound! Nay, we have been bewitched!, ^qAsad1515


They would say: Our sight is wrong - nay, but we are folk bewitched. ^qPickthall1515


yet would they say, 'Our eyes have been dazzled; nay, we are a people bewitched!' ^qArberry1515

# 16

Wa laqad ja'alnaa fissamaaa'i buroojanw wa zaiyannaahaa linnaazireen ^qTrans1516

so that anyone who seeks to learn [the unknowable] by stealth is pursued by a flame clear to see. ^qAsad1518


Save him who stealeth the hearing, and them doth a clear flame pursue. ^qPickthall1518


excepting such as listens by stealth -- and he is pursued by a manifest flame. ^qArberry1518

# 19

Wal arda madadnaahaa wa alqainaa feehaa rawaasiya wa ambatnaa feehaa min kulli shai'im mawzoon ^qTrans1519

Wa im min shai'in illaa 'indanaa khazaaa 'inuhoo wa maa nunazziluhooo illaa biqadarim ma'loom ^qTrans1521


For, no single thing exists that does not have its source with Us; and nought do We bestow from on high unless it be in accordance with a measure well-defined. ^qAsad1521


And there is not a thing but with Us are the stores thereof. And we send it not down save in appointed measure. ^qPickthall1521


Naught is there, but its treasuries are with Us, and We send it not down but in a known measure. ^qArberry1521

Wa arsalnar riyaaha la waaqiha fa anzalnaa minas samaaa'i maaa'an fa asqai naakumoohu wa maaa antum lahoo bikhaazineen ^qTrans1522


And We let loose the winds to fertilize [plants] and We send down water from the skies and let you drink thereof: and it is not you who dispose of its source- ^qAsad1522


And We send the winds fertilising, and cause water to descend from the sky, and give it you to drink. It is not ye who are the holders of the store thereof. ^qPickthall1522


And We loose the winds fertilising, and We send down out of heaven water, then We give it to you to drink, and you are not its treasurers. ^qArberry1522

Wa innnaa la nahnu nuhyee wa numeetu wa nahnul waarisoon ^qTrans1523


for, behold, it is We-We alone -who grant life and deal death, and it is We alone who shall remain after all else will have passed away! ^qAsad1523


Lo! and it is We, even We, Who quicken and give death, and We are the Inheritor. ^qPickthall1523

Waljaaanna khalaqnaahu min qablu min naaris samoom ^qTrans1527


whereas the invisible beings We had created, [long] before that, out of the fire of scorching winds. ^qAsad1527
