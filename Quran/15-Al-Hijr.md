Rubamaa yawaddul lazeena kafaroo law kaanoo muslimeen ^qTrans141

Wa maaa ahlaknaa min qaryatin illaa wa lahaa kitaabum ma'loom ^qTrans143

Maa tasbiqu min ummatin ajalahaa wa maa yastaakhiroon ^qTrans144


[but remember that] no community can ever forestall [the end of] its term - and neither can they delay [it]. ^qAsad144


No nation can outstrip its term nor can they lag behind. ^qPickthall144


and no nation outstrips its term, nor do they put it back. ^qArberry144

Maa nunazzilul malaaa'i kata illaa bilhaqqi wa maa kaanooo izam munzareen ^qTrans147


[Yet] We never send down angels otherwise than in accordance with the [demands of] truth; and [were the angels to appear now,] lo! they [who reject this divine writ] would have no further respite! ^qAsad147


We send not down the angels save with the Fact, and in that case (the disbelievers) would not be tolerated. ^qPickthall147

Behold, it is We Ourselves who have bestowed from on high, step by step, this reminder? and, behold, it is We who shall truly guard it [from all corruption]. ^qAsad148


Lo! We, even We, reveal the Reminder, and lo! We verily are its Guardian. ^qPickthall148

and never yet came an apostle to them without their deriding him. ^qAsad1410


And never came there unto them a messenger but they did mock him. ^qPickthall1410

kazaalika naslukuhoo fee quloobil mujrimeen ^qTrans1411


Even so do We [now] cause this [scorn of Our message] to pervade the hearts of those who are lost in sin, ^qAsad1411

even so We cause it to enter into the hearts of the sinners -- ^qArberry1411

Laa yu'minoona bihee wa qad khalat sunnatul awwaleen ^qTrans1412


who do not believe in it, although the way which those [evildoers] of olden times had to go has long been within their ken. ^qAsad1412

And even if We opened unto them a gate of heaven and they kept mounting through it, ^qPickthall1413


Though We opened to them a gate in heaven, and still they mounted through it, ^qArberry1413

For, no single thing exists that does not have its source with Us; and nought do We bestow from on high unless it be in accordance with a measure well-defined. ^qAsad1420


And there is not a thing but with Us are the stores thereof. And we send it not down save in appointed measure. ^qPickthall1420
