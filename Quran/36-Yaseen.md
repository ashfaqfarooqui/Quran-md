[The apostles] replied: “Your destiny, good or evil, is [bound up] with yourselves! [Does it seem evil to you] if you are told to take [the truth] to heart? Nay, but you are people who have wasted their own selves!” ^qAsad3518


They said: Your evil augury be with you! Is it because ye are reminded (of the truth)? Nay, but ye are froward folk! ^qPickthall3518


They said, 'Your augury is with you; if you are reminded? But you are a prodigal people.' ^qArberry3518

“[As for me,] why should I not worship Him who has brought me into being, and to whom you all will be brought back? ^qAsad3521


For what cause should I not serve Him Who hath created me, and unto Whom ye will be brought back? ^qPickthall3521


And why should I not serve Him who originated me, and unto whom you shall be returned? ^qArberry3521

'A-attakhizu min dooniheee aalihatan iny-yuridnir Rahmaanu bidurril-laa tughni 'annee shafaa 'atuhum shai 'anw-wa laa yunqizoon ^qTrans3522


Should I take to worship­ping [other] deities beside Him? [But then,] if the Most Gracious should will that harm befall me, their intercession could not in the least avail me, nor could they save me: ^qAsad3522


Shall I take (other) gods in place of Him when, if the Beneficent should wish me any harm, their intercession will avail me naught, nor can they save? ^qPickthall3522


What, shall I take, apart from Him, gods whose intercession, if the All-merciful desires affliction for me, shall not avail me anything, and who will never deliver me? ^qArberry3522

# 24

Inneee izal-lafee dalaa-lim-mubeen ^qTrans3523


and so, behold, I would have indeed, most obviously, lost myself in error! ^qAsad3523


Then truly I should be in error manifest. ^qPickthall3523

In kaanat illaa saihatanw waahidatan fa-izaa hum khaamidoon ^qTrans3528


nothing was [needed] but one single blast [of Our punishment] - and lo! they became as still and silent as ashes. ^qAsad3528


It was but one Shout, and lo! they were extinct. ^qPickthall3528


It was only one Cry and lo, they were silent and still. ^qArberry3528

Yaa hasratan 'alal 'ibaad; maa yaateehim mir Rasoolin illaa kaanoo bihee yastahzi 'oon ^qTrans3529


OH, THE REGRETS that [most] human beings will have to bear! Never has an apostle come to them without their deriding him! ^qAsad3529

# 32

Wa in kullul lammaa jamee'ul-ladainaa muhdaroon ^qTrans3531


and [that] all of them, all together, will [in the end] before Us be arraigned? ^qAsad3531


But all, without exception, will be brought before Us. ^qPickthall3531


They shall every one of them be arraigned before Us. ^qArberry3531

Subhaanal lazee khalaqal azwaaja kullahaa mimmaa tumbitul ardu wa min anfusihim wa mimmaa laa ya'lamoon ^qTrans3535


Limitless in His glory is He who has created opposites in whatever the earth produces, and in men’s own selves, and in that of which [as yet] they have no knowledge. ^qAsad3535

Wa Aayatul lahumul lailu naslakhu minhun nahaara fa-izaa hum muzlimoon ^qTrans3536


And [of Our sway over all that exists] they have a sign in the night: We withdraw from it the [light of] day - and lo! they are in darkness. ^qAsad3536

Wash-shamsu tajree limustaqarril lahaa; zaalika taqdeerul 'Azeezil Aleem ^qTrans3537


And [they have a sign in] the sun: it runs in an orbit of its own [and] that is laid down by the will of the Almighty, the All-Knowing; ^qAsad3537


And the sun runneth on unto a resting-place for him. That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Wise. ^qPickthall3537


And the sun -- it runs to a fixed resting-place; that is the ordaining of the All-mighty, the All-knowing. ^qArberry3537

# 39

Walqamara qaddarnaahu manaazila hattaa 'aada kal'ur joonil qadeem ^qTrans3538


and [in] the moon, for which We have determined phases [which it must traverse] till it becomes like an old date-stalk, dried-up and curved: ^qAsad3538


And for the moon We have appointed mansions till she return like an old shrivelled palm-leaf. ^qPickthall3538


And the moon -- We have determined it by stations, till it returns like an aged palm-bough. ^qArberry3538

# 40

Lash shamsu yambaghee lahaaa an tudrikal qamara wa lal lailu saabiqun nahaar; wa kullun fee falaki yasbahoon ^qTrans3539


[and] neither may the sun overtake the moon, nor can the night usurp the time of day, since all of them float through space [in accordance with Our laws]. ^qAsad3539


It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor doth the night outstrip the day. They float each in an orbit. ^qPickthall3539


It behoves not the sun to overtake the moon, neither does the night outstrip the day, each swimming in a sky. ^qArberry3539

# 41

Wa Aayatul lahum annaa hamalnaa zurriyatahum fil fulkil mashhoon ^qTrans3540


And [it ought to be] a sign for them that We bear their offspring [over the seas] in laden ships, ^qAsad3540

# 42

Wa khalaqnaa lahum mim-mislihee maa yarkaboon ^qTrans3541


and [that] We create for them things of a similar kind, on which they may embark [in their travels]; ^qAsad3541


And have created for them of the like thereof whereon they ride. ^qPickthall3541


and We have created for them the like of it whereon they ride; ^qArberry3541

# 43

Wa in nashaa nughriqhum falaa sareekha lahum wa laa hum yunqazoon ^qTrans3542


and [that,] if such be Our will, We may cause them to drown, with none to respond to their cry for help: and [then] they cannot be saved, ^qAsad3542


And if We will, We drown them, and there is no help for them, neither can they be saved; ^qPickthall3542


and if We will, We drown them, then none have they to cry to, neither are they delivered, ^qArberry3542

# 44

Illaa rahmatam minnaa wa mataa'an ilaa heen ^qTrans3543


unless it be by an act of mercy from Us and a grant of life for a [further span of] time. ^qAsad3543


Unless by mercy from Us and as comfort for a while. ^qPickthall3543

# 45

Wa izaa qeela lahumuttaqoo maa baina aideekum wa maa khalfakum la'allakum turhamoon ^qTrans3544


And [yet,] when they are told, “Beware of [God’s insight into] all that lies open before you and all that is hidden from you, so that you might be graced with His mercy,” [most men choose to remain deaf;] ^qAsad3544


When it is said unto them: Beware of that which is before you and that which is behind you, that haply ye may find mercy (they are heedless). ^qPickthall3544


And when it is said to them, 'Fear what is before you and what is behind you; haply you will find mercy' -- ^qArberry3544

# 46

Wa maa taateehim min aayatim min ayataati Rabbihim illaa kaanoo 'anhaa mu'rideen ^qTrans3545


and no message of their Sustainer s messages ever reaches them without their turning away from it. ^qAsad3545


Never came a token of the tokens of their Lord to them, but they did turn away from it! ^qPickthall3545


yet never any sign of the signs of their Lord comes to them, but they are turning away from it. ^qArberry3545

# 47

Wa izaa qeela lahum anfiqoo mimmaa razaqakumul laahu qaalal lazeena kafaroo lillazeena aamanooo anut'imu mal-law yashaaa'ul laahu at'amahooo in antum illaa fee dalaalim mubeen ^qTrans3546


Thus, when they are told, “Spend on others out of what God has provided for you as sus­tenance,” those who are bent on denying the truth say unto those who believe, “Shall we feed anyone whom, if [your] God had so willed, He could have fed [Himself]? Clearly, you are but lost in error!” ^qAsad3546


And when it is said unto them: Spend of that wherewith Allah hath provided you, those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Shall we feed those whom Allah, if He willed, would feed? Ye are in naught else than error manifest. ^qPickthall3546


And when it is said to them, 'Expend of that God has provided you,' the unbelievers say to the believers, 'What, shall we feed such a one whom, if God willed, He would feed? You are only in manifest error!' ^qArberry3546

# 48

Wa yaqooloona mataa haazal wa'du in kuntum saadiqeen ^qTrans3547


And they add, “When is this promise [of resurrection] to be fulfilled? [Answer this] if you are men of truth!” ^qAsad3547


And they say: When will this promise be fulfilled, if ye are truthful? ^qPickthall3547


They also say, 'When shall this promise come to pass, if you speak truly?' ^qArberry3547

# 49

Maa yanzuroona illaa saihatanw waahidatan taa khuzuhum wa hum yakhissimoon ^qTrans3548


[And they are unaware that] nothing awaits them beyond a single blast [of God’s punishment], which will overtake them while they are still arguing - [against resurrection]: ^qAsad3548


They await but one Shout, which will surprise them while they are disputing. ^qPickthall3548
