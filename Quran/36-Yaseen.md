Wa maa 'alainaaa illal balaaghul mubeen ^qTrans3617


but we are not bound to do more than clearly deliver the mes­sage [entrusted to us].” ^qAsad3617

and it is only for us to deliver the Manifest Message.' ^qArberry3617

Qaaloo taaa'irukum ma'akum; a'in zukkirtum; bal antum qawmum musrifoon ^qTrans3619


[The apostles] replied: “Your destiny, good or evil, is [bound up] with yourselves! [Does it seem evil to you] if you are told to take [the truth] to heart? Nay, but you are people who have wasted their own selves!” ^qAsad3619


They said: Your evil augury be with you! Is it because ye are reminded (of the truth)? Nay, but ye are froward folk! ^qPickthall3619


They said, 'Your augury is with you; if you are reminded? But you are a prodigal people.' ^qArberry3619

Wa jaaa'a min aqsal madeenati rajuluny yas'aa qaala yaa qawmit tabi'ul mursaleen ^qTrans3620

Wa maa liya laaa a'budul lazee fataranee wa ilaihi turja'oon ^qTrans3622


“[As for me,] why should I not worship Him who has brought me into being, and to whom you all will be brought back? ^qAsad3622


For what cause should I not serve Him Who hath created me, and unto Whom ye will be brought back? ^qPickthall3622


And why should I not serve Him who originated me, and unto whom you shall be returned? ^qArberry3622

# 23

'A-attakhizu min dooniheee aalihatan iny-yuridnir Rahmaanu bidurril-laa tughni 'annee shafaa 'atuhum shai 'anw-wa laa yunqizoon ^qTrans3623


Should I take to worship­ping [other] deities beside Him? [But then,] if the Most Gracious should will that harm befall me, their intercession could not in the least avail me, nor could they save me: ^qAsad3623


Shall I take (other) gods in place of Him when, if the Beneficent should wish me any harm, their intercession will avail me naught, nor can they save? ^qPickthall3623


What, shall I take, apart from Him, gods whose intercession, if the All-merciful desires affliction for me, shall not avail me anything, and who will never deliver me? ^qArberry3623

# 24

Inneee izal-lafee dalaa-lim-mubeen ^qTrans3624


and so, behold, I would have indeed, most obviously, lost myself in error! ^qAsad3624


Then truly I should be in error manifest. ^qPickthall3624


Surely in that case I should be in manifest error. ^qArberry3624

# 25

Inneee aamantu bi Rabbikum fasma'oon ^qTrans3625

And after that, no host out of heaven did We send down against his people, nor did We need to send down any: ^qAsad3628


We sent not down against his people after him a host from heaven, nor do We ever send. ^qPickthall3628


And We sent not down upon his people, after him, any host out of heaven; neither would We send any down. ^qArberry3628

# 29

In kaanat illaa saihatanw waahidatan fa-izaa hum khaamidoon ^qTrans3629


nothing was [needed] but one single blast [of Our punishment] - and lo! they became as still and silent as ashes. ^qAsad3629


It was but one Shout, and lo! they were extinct. ^qPickthall3629


It was only one Cry and lo, they were silent and still. ^qArberry3629

# 30

Yaa hasratan 'alal 'ibaad; maa yaateehim mir Rasoolin illaa kaanoo bihee yastahzi 'oon ^qTrans3630


OH, THE REGRETS that [most] human beings will have to bear! Never has an apostle come to them without their deriding him! ^qAsad3630


Ah, the anguish for the bondmen! Never came there unto them a messenger but they did mock him! ^qPickthall3630

Are they not aware of how many a generation We have destroyed before their time, [and] that those [that have perished] will never return to them, ^qAsad3631


Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, which indeed returned not unto them; ^qPickthall3631


What, have they not seen how many generations We have destroyed before them, and that it is not unto them that they return? ^qArberry3631

# 32

Wa in kullul lammaa jamee'ul-ladainaa muhdaroon ^qTrans3632


and [that] all of them, all together, will [in the end] before Us be arraigned? ^qAsad3632


But all, without exception, will be brought before Us. ^qPickthall3632


They shall every one of them be arraigned before Us. ^qArberry3632

# 33

Wa Aayatul lahumul ardul maitatu ahyainaahaa wa akhrajnaa minhaa habban faminhu yaakuloon ^qTrans3633

and [how] We make gardens of date-palms and vines [grow] thereon, and cause springs to gush [forth] within it, ^qAsad3634


And We have placed therein gardens of the date-palm and grapes, and We have caused springs of water to gush forth therein, ^qPickthall3634


and We made therein gardens of palms and vines, and therein We caused fountains to gush forth, ^qArberry3634

Liyaakuloo min samarihee wa maa 'amilat-hu aideehim; afalaa yashkuroon ^qTrans3635


so that they may eat of the fruit thereof, though it was not their hands that made it. Will they not, then, be grateful? ^qAsad3635


That they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands made it not. Will they not, then, give thanks? ^qPickthall3635


that they might eat of its fruits and their hands' labour. What, will they not be thankful? ^qArberry3635

# 36

Subhaanal lazee khalaqal azwaaja kullahaa mimmaa tumbitul ardu wa min anfusihim wa mimmaa laa ya'lamoon ^qTrans3636


Limitless in His glory is He who has created opposites in whatever the earth produces, and in men’s own selves, and in that of which [as yet] they have no knowledge. ^qAsad3636

# 37

Wa Aayatul lahumul lailu naslakhu minhun nahaara fa-izaa hum muzlimoon ^qTrans3637


And [of Our sway over all that exists] they have a sign in the night: We withdraw from it the [light of] day - and lo! they are in darkness. ^qAsad3637


A token unto them is night. We strip it of the day, and lo! they are in darkness. ^qPickthall3637

# 38

Wash-shamsu tajree limustaqarril lahaa; zaalika taqdeerul 'Azeezil Aleem ^qTrans3638


And [they have a sign in] the sun: it runs in an orbit of its own [and] that is laid down by the will of the Almighty, the All-Knowing; ^qAsad3638


And the sun runneth on unto a resting-place for him. That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Wise. ^qPickthall3638


And the sun -- it runs to a fixed resting-place; that is the ordaining of the All-mighty, the All-knowing. ^qArberry3638

# 39

Walqamara qaddarnaahu manaazila hattaa 'aada kal'ur joonil qadeem ^qTrans3639


and [in] the moon, for which We have determined phases [which it must traverse] till it becomes like an old date-stalk, dried-up and curved: ^qAsad3639


And for the moon We have appointed mansions till she return like an old shrivelled palm-leaf. ^qPickthall3639


And the moon -- We have determined it by stations, till it returns like an aged palm-bough. ^qArberry3639

# 40

Lash shamsu yambaghee lahaaa an tudrikal qamara wa lal lailu saabiqun nahaar; wa kullun fee falaki yasbahoon ^qTrans3640


[and] neither may the sun overtake the moon, nor can the night usurp the time of day, since all of them float through space [in accordance with Our laws]. ^qAsad3640


It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor doth the night outstrip the day. They float each in an orbit. ^qPickthall3640


It behoves not the sun to overtake the moon, neither does the night outstrip the day, each swimming in a sky. ^qArberry3640

# 41

Wa Aayatul lahum annaa hamalnaa zurriyatahum fil fulkil mashhoon ^qTrans3641


And [it ought to be] a sign for them that We bear their offspring [over the seas] in laden ships, ^qAsad3641

# 42

Wa khalaqnaa lahum mim-mislihee maa yarkaboon ^qTrans3642


and [that] We create for them things of a similar kind, on which they may embark [in their travels]; ^qAsad3642


And have created for them of the like thereof whereon they ride. ^qPickthall3642


and We have created for them the like of it whereon they ride; ^qArberry3642

# 43

Wa in nashaa nughriqhum falaa sareekha lahum wa laa hum yunqazoon ^qTrans3643


and [that,] if such be Our will, We may cause them to drown, with none to respond to their cry for help: and [then] they cannot be saved, ^qAsad3643


And if We will, We drown them, and there is no help for them, neither can they be saved; ^qPickthall3643


and if We will, We drown them, then none have they to cry to, neither are they delivered, ^qArberry3643

# 44

Illaa rahmatam minnaa wa mataa'an ilaa heen ^qTrans3644


unless it be by an act of mercy from Us and a grant of life for a [further span of] time. ^qAsad3644


Unless by mercy from Us and as comfort for a while. ^qPickthall3644


save as a mercy from Us, and enjoyment for a while. ^qArberry3644

# 45

Wa izaa qeela lahumuttaqoo maa baina aideekum wa maa khalfakum la'allakum turhamoon ^qTrans3645


And [yet,] when they are told, “Beware of [God’s insight into] all that lies open before you and all that is hidden from you, so that you might be graced with His mercy,” [most men choose to remain deaf;] ^qAsad3645


When it is said unto them: Beware of that which is before you and that which is behind you, that haply ye may find mercy (they are heedless). ^qPickthall3645


And when it is said to them, 'Fear what is before you and what is behind you; haply you will find mercy' -- ^qArberry3645

# 46

Wa maa taateehim min aayatim min ayataati Rabbihim illaa kaanoo 'anhaa mu'rideen ^qTrans3646


and no message of their Sustainer s messages ever reaches them without their turning away from it. ^qAsad3646


Never came a token of the tokens of their Lord to them, but they did turn away from it! ^qPickthall3646


yet never any sign of the signs of their Lord comes to them, but they are turning away from it. ^qArberry3646

# 47

Wa izaa qeela lahum anfiqoo mimmaa razaqakumul laahu qaalal lazeena kafaroo lillazeena aamanooo anut'imu mal-law yashaaa'ul laahu at'amahooo in antum illaa fee dalaalim mubeen ^qTrans3647


Thus, when they are told, “Spend on others out of what God has provided for you as sus­tenance,” those who are bent on denying the truth say unto those who believe, “Shall we feed anyone whom, if [your] God had so willed, He could have fed [Himself]? Clearly, you are but lost in error!” ^qAsad3647


And when it is said unto them: Spend of that wherewith Allah hath provided you, those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Shall we feed those whom Allah, if He willed, would feed? Ye are in naught else than error manifest. ^qPickthall3647


And when it is said to them, 'Expend of that God has provided you,' the unbelievers say to the believers, 'What, shall we feed such a one whom, if God willed, He would feed? You are only in manifest error!' ^qArberry3647

# 48

Wa yaqooloona mataa haazal wa'du in kuntum saadiqeen ^qTrans3648


And they add, “When is this promise [of resurrection] to be fulfilled? [Answer this] if you are men of truth!” ^qAsad3648


And they say: When will this promise be fulfilled, if ye are truthful? ^qPickthall3648


They also say, 'When shall this promise come to pass, if you speak truly?' ^qArberry3648

# 49

Maa yanzuroona illaa saihatanw waahidatan taa khuzuhum wa hum yakhissimoon ^qTrans3649


[And they are unaware that] nothing awaits them beyond a single blast [of God’s punishment], which will overtake them while they are still arguing - [against resurrection]: ^qAsad3649
