THESE ARE MESSAGES of the divine writ, clear in itself and clearly showing the truth! ^qAsad251


These are revelations of the Scripture that maketh plain. ^qPickthall251


Those are the signs of the Manifest Book. ^qArberry251

La'allaka baakhi'un nafsaka allaa yakoonoo mu'mineen ^qTrans252


Wouldst thou, perhaps, torment thyself to death [with grief] because they [who live around thee] refuse to believe [in it]? ^qAsad252

In nashaa nunazzil 'alaihim minas samaaa'i Aayatan fazallat a'naaquhum lahaa khaadi'een ^qTrans253


Had We so willed, We could have sent down unto them a message from the skies, so that their necks would [be forced to] bow down before it in humility. ^qAsad253


If We will, We can send down on them from the sky a portent so that their necks would remain bowed before it. ^qPickthall253

# 5

Wa maa yaateehim min zikrim minar Rahmaani muhdasin illaa kaanoo 'anhu mu'rideen ^qTrans254


[But We have not willed it:] and so, whenever there comes unto them any fresh reminder from the Most Gracious, they [who are blind of heart] always - turn their backs upon it: ^qAsad254


Never cometh there unto them a fresh reminder from the Beneficent One, but they turn away from it. ^qPickthall254


But never fresh remembrance comes to them from the All-merciful, except they turn away from it. ^qArberry254

# 6

Faqad kazzaboo fasa yaateehim ambaaa'u maa kaanoo bihee yastahzi'oon ^qTrans255


thus, indeed, have they given the lie (to this message as well). But [in time] they will come to understand what it was that they were wont to deride! ^qAsad255


Now they have denied (the Truth); but there will come unto them tidings of that whereat they used to scoff. ^qPickthall255


So they have cried lies; therefore assuredly tidings will come to them of that they mocked at. ^qArberry255

Awa lam yaraw ilal ardi kam ambatnaa feehaa min kulli zawjin kareem ^qTrans256


Have they, then, never considered the earth - how much of every noble kind [of life] We have caused to grow thereon? ^qAsad256


Have they not seen the earth, how much of every fruitful kind We make to grow therein? ^qPickthall256

In this, behold, there is a message [unto men], even though most of them will not believe [in it]. ^qAsad257


Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers. ^qPickthall257


Surely in that is a sign, yet most of them are not believers. ^qArberry257

# 9

Wa inna Rabbaka la Huwal 'Azeezur Raheem ^qTrans258


But, verily, thy Sustainer - He alone - is almighty, a dispenser of grace! ^qAsad258


And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. ^qPickthall258

and then my breast will be straitened and my tongue will not be free: send, then, [this Thy command] to Aaron. ^qAsad2512


And I shall be embarrassed, and my tongue will not speak plainly, therefor send for Aaron (to help me). ^qPickthall2512

Then I fled from you when I feared you, and my Lord vouchsafed me a command and appointed me (of the number) of those sent (by Him). ^qPickthall2520
