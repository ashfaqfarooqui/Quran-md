Tilka Aayaatul Kitaabil Mubeen ^qTrans262


THESE ARE MESSAGES of the divine writ, clear in itself and clearly showing the truth! ^qAsad262


These are revelations of the Scripture that maketh plain. ^qPickthall262


Those are the signs of the Manifest Book. ^qArberry262

La'allaka baakhi'un nafsaka allaa yakoonoo mu'mineen ^qTrans263


Wouldst thou, perhaps, torment thyself to death [with grief] because they [who live around thee] refuse to believe [in it]? ^qAsad263


It may be that thou tormentest thyself (O Muhammad) because they believe not. ^qPickthall263


Perchance thou consumest thyself that they are not believers. ^qArberry263

# 4

In nashaa nunazzil 'alaihim minas samaaa'i Aayatan fazallat a'naaquhum lahaa khaadi'een ^qTrans264


Had We so willed, We could have sent down unto them a message from the skies, so that their necks would [be forced to] bow down before it in humility. ^qAsad264


If We will, We can send down on them from the sky a portent so that their necks would remain bowed before it. ^qPickthall264


If We will, We shall send down on them out of heaven a sign, so their necks will stay humbled to it. ^qArberry264

# 5

Wa maa yaateehim min zikrim minar Rahmaani muhdasin illaa kaanoo 'anhu mu'rideen ^qTrans265


[But We have not willed it:] and so, whenever there comes unto them any fresh reminder from the Most Gracious, they [who are blind of heart] always - turn their backs upon it: ^qAsad265


Never cometh there unto them a fresh reminder from the Beneficent One, but they turn away from it. ^qPickthall265


But never fresh remembrance comes to them from the All-merciful, except they turn away from it. ^qArberry265

# 6

Faqad kazzaboo fasa yaateehim ambaaa'u maa kaanoo bihee yastahzi'oon ^qTrans266


thus, indeed, have they given the lie (to this message as well). But [in time] they will come to understand what it was that they were wont to deride! ^qAsad266


Now they have denied (the Truth); but there will come unto them tidings of that whereat they used to scoff. ^qPickthall266


So they have cried lies; therefore assuredly tidings will come to them of that they mocked at. ^qArberry266

# 7

Awa lam yaraw ilal ardi kam ambatnaa feehaa min kulli zawjin kareem ^qTrans267


Have they, then, never considered the earth - how much of every noble kind [of life] We have caused to grow thereon? ^qAsad267


Have they not seen the earth, how much of every fruitful kind We make to grow therein? ^qPickthall267


What, have they not regarded the earth, how many therein We have caused to grow of every generous kind? ^qArberry267

# 8

Inn fee zaalika la Aayah; wa maa kaana aksaruhum mu'mineen ^qTrans268


In this, behold, there is a message [unto men], even though most of them will not believe [in it]. ^qAsad268


Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers. ^qPickthall268


Surely in that is a sign, yet most of them are not believers. ^qArberry268

# 9

Wa inna Rabbaka la Huwal 'Azeezur Raheem ^qTrans269


But, verily, thy Sustainer - He alone - is almighty, a dispenser of grace! ^qAsad269


And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. ^qPickthall269


Surely thy Lord, He is the All-mighty, the All-compassionate. ^qArberry269

The folk of Pharaoh. Will they not ward off (evil)? ^qPickthall2611


the people of Pharaoh; will they not be godfearing?' ^qArberry2611

# 12

Qaala Rabbi inneee akhaafu ai yukazziboon ^qTrans2612


He answered: “O my Sustainer! Behold, I fear that they will give me the lie, ^qAsad2612


He said: My Lord! Lo! I fear that they will deny me, ^qPickthall2612


He said, 'My Lord, I fear they will cry me lies, ^qArberry2612

# 13

Wa yadeequ sadree wa laa yantaliqu lisaanee fa arsil ilaa Haaroon ^qTrans2613


and then my breast will be straitened and my tongue will not be free: send, then, [this Thy command] to Aaron. ^qAsad2613


And I shall be embarrassed, and my tongue will not speak plainly, therefor send for Aaron (to help me). ^qPickthall2613


and my breast will be straitened, and my tongue will not be loosed; so send to Aaron. ^qArberry2613

# 14

Wa lahum 'alaiya zambun fa akhaafu ai yaqtuloon ^qTrans2614


Moreover, they keep a grave charge [pending] against me, and I fear that they will slay me.” ^qAsad2614


And they have a crime against me, so I fear that they will kill me. ^qPickthall2614


They also have a sin against me, and I fear they will slay me.' ^qArberry2614

# 15

Qaala kallaa fazhabaa bi Aayaatinaaa innaa ma'akum mustami'oon ^qTrans2615


Said He: “Not so, indeed! Go forth, then, both of you, with Our messages: verify, We shall be with you, listening [to your call]! ^qAsad2615


He said: Nay, verily. So go ye twain with Our tokens. Lo! We shall be with you, Hearing. ^qPickthall2615


Said He, 'No indeed; but go, both of you, with Our signs, and We assuredly shall be with you, listening. ^qArberry2615

And come together unto Pharaoh and say: Lo! we bear a message of the Lord of the Worlds, ^qPickthall2616


So go you to Pharaoh, and say, "Verily, I am the Messenger of the Lord of all Being; ^qArberry2616

[But when Moses had delivered his message, Pharaoh] said: “Did we not bring thee up among us when thou wert a child? And didst thou not spend among us years of thy [later] life? ^qAsad2618


(Pharaoh) said (unto Moses): Did we not rear thee among us as a child? And thou didst dwell many years of thy life among us, ^qPickthall2618


He said, 'Did we not raise thee amongst us as a child? Didst thou not tarry among us years of thy life? ^qArberry2618

Wa fa'alta fa'latakal latee fa'alta wa anta minal kaafireen ^qTrans2619


And yet thou didst commit that [heinous] deed of thine, and [hast thus shown that] thou art one of the ingrate!” ^qAsad2619


And thou didst that thy deed which thou didst, and thou wast one of the ingrates. ^qPickthall2619


And thou didst the deed thou didst, being one of the ungrateful!' ^qArberry2619

# 20

Qaala fa'altuhaaa izanw wa ana minad daaaleen ^qTrans2620


Replied [Moses]: “I committed it while I was still going astray; ^qAsad2620

# 21

Fafarartu minkum lam maa khiftukum fawahaba lee Rabbee hukmanw wa ja'alanee minal mursaleen ^qTrans2621


and I fled from you because I feared you. But [since] then my Sustainer has endowed me with the ability to judge [between right and wrong], and has made me one of [His] message-­bearers. ^qAsad2621


Then I fled from you when I feared you, and my Lord vouchsafed me a command and appointed me (of the number) of those sent (by Him). ^qPickthall2621


so I fled from you, fearing you. But my Lord gave me Judgment and made me one of the Envoys. ^qArberry2621

# 22

Wa tilka ni'matun tamun nuhaa 'alaiya an 'abbatta Baneee Israaa'eel ^qTrans2622


And [as for] that favour of which thou so tauntingly remindest me - [was it not] due to thy having enslaved the children of Israel?” ^qAsad2622


And this is the past favour wherewith thou reproachest me: that thou hast enslaved the Children of Israel. ^qPickthall2622


That is a blessing thou reproachest me with, having enslaved the Children of Israel.' ^qArberry2622
