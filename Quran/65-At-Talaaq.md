Yaaa ayyuhan nabiyyu izaa tallaqtummun nisaaa'a fatalliqoohunna li'iddatihinna wa ahsul'iddata; wattaqul laaha rabbakum laa tukhri joohunna mim bu-yootihinna wa laa yakhrujna illaaa any yaateema bifaahishatim mubaiyinah; wa tilka hudoodul laah; wa many yata'adda hudoodal laahi faqad zalama nafsha; laa tadree la'allal laaha yuhdisu ba'dazaalika amraa ^qTrans651


O PROPHET! When you [intend to divorce women, divorce them with a view to the waiting period appointed for them, and reckon the period [carefully], and be conscious of God, your Sustainer. Do not expel them from their homes; and neither shall they [be made to] leave unless they become openly guilty of immoral conduct. These, then, are the bounds set by God - and he who transgresses the bounds set by God does indeed sin against himself: [for, O man, although] thou knowest it not, after that [first breach] God may well cause something new to come about. ^qAsad651


O Prophet! When ye (men) put away women, put them away for their (legal) period and reckon the period, and keep your duty to Allah, your Lord. Expel them not from their houses nor let them go forth unless they commit open immorality. Such are the limits (imposed by) Allah; and whoso transgresseth Allah's limits, he verily wrongeth his soul. Thou knowest not: it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass. ^qPickthall651


O Prophet, when you divorce women, divorce them when they have reached their period. Count the period, and fear God your Lord. Do not expel them from their houses, nor let them go forth, except when they commit a flagrant indecency. Those are God's bounds; whosoever trespasses the bounds of God has done wrong to himself. Thou knowest not, perchance after that God will bring something new to pass. ^qArberry651

Fa izaa balaghna ajalahunna fa amsikoohunna bima'roofin aw faariqoohunna bima'roofinw wa ashhidoo zawai 'adlim minkum wa aqeemush shahaadata lillaah; zaalikum yoo'azu bihee man kaana yu'minu billaahi wal yawmil aakhir; wa many yattaqil laaha yaj'al lahoo makhrajaa ^qTrans652


And so, when they are about to reach the end of their waiting-term, either retain them in a fair manner or part with them in a fair manner. And let two persons of [known] probity from among your own community witness [what you have decided]; and do yourselves bear true witness before God: thus are admonished all who believe in God and the Last Day. And unto everyone who is conscious of God, He [always] grants a way out [of unhappiness], ^qAsad652


Then, when they have reached their term, take them back in kindness or part from them in kindness, and call to witness two just men among you, and keep your testimony upright for Allah. Whoso believeth in Allah and the Last Day is exhorted to act thus. And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah, Allah will appoint a way out for him, ^qPickthall652


Then, when they have reached their term, retain them honourably, or part from them honourably. And call in to witness two men of equity from among yourselves; and perform the witnessing to God Himself. By this then is admonished whosoever believes in God and the Last Day. And whosoever fears God, He will appoint for him a way out, ^qArberry652

Wa yarzuqhu min haisu laa yahtasib; wa many yatawakkal 'alal laahi fahuwa husbuh; innal laaha baalighu amrih; qad ja'alal laahu likulli shai'in qadraa ^qTrans653


and provides for him in a manner beyond all expectation; and for everyone who places his trust in God He [alone] is enough. Verily, God always attains to His purpose: [and] indeed, unto everything has God appointed its [term and] measure. ^qAsad653


And will provide for him from (a quarter) whence he hath no expectation. And whosoever putteth his trust in Allah, He will suffice him. Lo! Allah bringeth His command to pass. Allah hath set a measure for all things. ^qPickthall653


and He will provide for him from whence he never reckoned. And whosoever puts his trust in God, He shall suffice him. God attains his purpose. God has appointed a measure for everything. ^qArberry653

Wallaaa'ee ya'isna minal maheedi min nisaaa 'ikum inir tabtum fa'iddatuhunna salaasatu ashhurinw wallaaa'ee lam yahidn; wa ulaatul ahmaali ajaluhunna any yada'na hamlahun; wa many yattaqil laaha yaj'al lahoo min armrihee yusraa ^qTrans654


Now as for such of your women as are beyond, the age of monthly courses, as well as for such as do not have any courses, their waiting-period - if you have any doubt [about it] - shall be three [calendar] months; and as for those who are with child, the end of their waiting-term shall come when they deliver their burden. And for everyone who is conscious of God, He makes it easy to obey His commandment: ^qAsad654


And for such of your women as despair of menstruation, if ye doubt, their period (of waiting) shall be three months, along with those who have it not. And for those with child, their period shall be till they bring forth their burden. And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah, He maketh his course easy for him. ^qPickthall654


As for your women who have despaired of further menstruating, if you are in doubt, their period shall be three months; and those who have not menstruated as yet. And those who are with child, their term is when they bring forth their burden. Whoso fears God, God will appoint for him, of His command, easiness. ^qArberry654

Zaalika amrul laahi anzalahoo ilaikum; wa many yattaqil laaha yukaffir 'anhu saiyi aatihee wa yu'zim lahoo ajraa ^qTrans655


[for] all this is God's commandment, which He has bestowed upon you from on high. And unto everyone who is conscious of God will He pardon [some of] his bad deeds, and will grant him a vast reward. ^qAsad655


That is the commandment of Allah which He revealeth unto you. And whoso keepeth his duty to Allah, He will remit from him his evil deeds and magnify reward for him. ^qPickthall655


That is God's command, that He has sent down unto you. And whosoever fears God, He will acquit him of his evil deeds, and He will give him a mighty wage. ^qArberry655

Askinoohunna min haisu sakantum minw wujdikum wa laa tudaaarroohunna litudaiyiqoo 'alaihinn; wa in kunna ulaati hamlin fa anfiqoo 'alihinna hattaa yada'na hamlahunn; fain arda'na lakum fa aatoo hunna ujoorahunna waatamiroo bainakum bima'roofinw wa in ta'aasartum fasaturdi'u lahooo ukhraa ^qTrans656


[Hence,] let the women [who are undergoing a waiting-period] live in the same manner as you live yourselves, In accordance with your means; and do not harass them with a view to making their lives a misery. And if they happen to be with child, spend freely on them until they deliver their burden; and if they nurse your offspring [after the divorce has become final], give them their [due] recompense; and take counsel with one another in a fair manner [about the child's future]. And if both of you find it difficult [that the mother should nurse the child], let another woman nurse it on behalf of him [who has begotten it]. ^qAsad656


Lodge them where ye dwell, according to your wealth, and harass them not so as to straiten life for them. And if they are with child, then spend for them till they bring forth their burden. Then, if they give suck for you, give them their due payment and consult together in kindness; but if ye make difficulties for one another, then let some other woman give suck for him (the father of the child). ^qPickthall656


Lodge them where you are lodging, according to your means, and do not press them, so as to straiten their circumstances. If they are with child, expend upon them until they bring forth their burden. If they suckle for you, give them their wages, and consult together honourably. If you both make difficulties, another woman shall suckle for him. ^qArberry656

Liyuntiq zoo sa'atim min sa'atihee wa man qudira 'alaihi riquhoo falyunfiq mimmaaa aataahul laah; laa yukalliful laahu nafsan illaa maaa aataahaa; sa yaj'alul laahu ba'da'usriny yusraa ^qTrans657


[In all these respects,] let him who has ample means spend in accordance with his amplitude; and let him whose means of subsistence are scanty spend in accordance with what God has given him: God does not burden any human being with more than He has given him - [and it may well be that] God will grant, after hardship, ease. ^qAsad657


Let him who hath abundance spend of his abundance, and he whose provision is measured, let him spend of that which Allah hath given him. Allah asketh naught of any soul save that which He hath given it. Allah will vouchsafe, after hardship, ease. ^qPickthall657


Let the man of plenty expend out of his plenty. As for him whose provision is stinted to him, let him expend of what God has given him. God charges no soul save with what He has given him. God will assuredly appoint, after difficulty, easiness. ^qArberry657
