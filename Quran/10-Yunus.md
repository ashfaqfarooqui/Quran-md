A kaana linnaasi 'aaban an awhainaaa ilaa rajulim minhum an anzirin naasa wa bashshiril lazeena aamanoo anna lahum qadama sidqin 'inda Rabbihim; qaalal kaafiroona inna haaza lasaahirum mubeen ^qTrans102


Do people deem it strange that We should have inspired a man from their own midst [with this Our message]: "Warn all mankind, and give unto those who have attained to faith the glad tiding that in their Sustainer's sight they surpass all others in that they are completely sincere-? [Only] they who deny the truth say, "Behold. he is clearly but a spellbinder!" ^qAsad102


Is it a wonder for mankind that We have inspired a man among them, saying: Warn mankind and bring unto those who believe the good tidings that they have a sure footing with their Lord? The disbelievers say: Lo! this is a mere wizard. ^qPickthall102


Was it a wonder to the people that We revealed to a man from among them: 'Warn the people, and give thou good tidings to the believers that they have a sure footing with their Lord'? The unbelievers say, 'This is a manifest sorcerer.' ^qArberry102

Inna Rabbakumul laahul lazee khalaqas samaawaati wal arda fee sittati aiyaamin summas tawaa 'alal 'Arshi yudabbirul amra maa min shafee'in illaa mim ba'di iznih; zalikumul laahu Rabbukum fa'budooh; afalaa tazakkaroon ^qTrans103


VERILY, your Sustainer is God, who has created the heavens and the earth in six aeons, and is established on the throne of His almightiness, governing all that exists. There is none that could intercede with Him unless He grants leave therefor. Thus is God, your Sustainer: worship, therefore, Him [alone]: will you not, then, keep this in mind? ^qAsad103


Lo! your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days, then He established Himself upon the Throne, directing all things. There is no intercessor (with Him) save after His permission. That is Allah, your Lord, so worship Him. Oh, will ye not remind? ^qPickthall103


Surely your Lord is God, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then sat Himself upon the Throne, directing the affair. Intercessor there is none, save after His leave that then is God, your Lord; so serve Him. Will you not remember? ^qArberry103

Ilaihi marji'ukum jamee 'anw wa'dal laahi haqqaa; innahoo yabda'ul khalqa summa yu'eeduhoo liyajziyal lazeena aamanoo wa 'amilus saalihaati bilqist; wallazeena kafaroo lahum sharaabum min hamee minw wa 'azaabun aleemum bimaa kaanoo yakfuroon ^qTrans104


Unto Him you all must return: this is, in truth, God's promise-for, behold, He creates [man] in the first instance, and then brings him forth anew to the end that He may reward with equity all who attain to faith and do righteous deeds; whereas for those who are bent on denying the truth there is in store a draught of burning despair and grievous suffering because of their persistent refusal to acknowledge the truth. ^qAsad104


Unto Him is the return of all of you; it is a promise of Allah in truth. Lo! He produceth creation, then reproduceth it, that He may reward those who believe and do good works with equity; while, as for those who disbelieve, theirs will be a boiling drink and painful doom because they disbelieved. ^qPickthall104


To Him shall you return, all together -- God's promise, in truth. He originates creation, then He brings it back again that He may recompense those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, justly. And those who disbelieve -- for them awaits a draught of boiling water, and a painful chastisement, for their disbelieving. ^qArberry104

He it is who has made the sun a [source of] radiant light and the moon a light [reflected], and has determined for it phases so that you might know how to compute the years and to measure [time]. None of this has God created without [an inner] truth. Clearly does He spell out these messages unto people of [innate] knowledge: ^qAsad105


He it is Who appointed the sun a splendour and the moon a light, and measured for her stages, that ye might know the number of the years, and the reckoning. Allah created not (all) that save in truth. He detaileth the revelations for people who have knowledge. ^qPickthall105


It is He who made the sun a radiance, and the moon a light, and determined it by stations, that you might know the number of the years and the reckoning. God created that not save with the truth, distinguishing the signs to a people who know. ^qArberry105

Inna fikh tilaafil laili wannahaari wa maa khalaqal laahu fis samaawaati wal ardi la Aayaatil liqawminy yattaqoon ^qTrans106


for, verily, in the alternating of night and day, and in all that God has created in the heavens and on earth there are messages indeed for people who are conscious of Him! ^qAsad106


Lo! in the difference of day and night and all that Allah hath created in the heavens and the earth are portents, verily, for folk who ward off (evil). ^qPickthall106


In the alternation of night and day, and what God has created in the heavens and the earth -- surely there are signs for a godfearing people. ^qArberry106

Innal lazeena laa yarjoona liqaaa'anaa wa radoo bilhayaatid dunyaa watma annoo bihaa wallazeena hum 'an Aayaatinaa ghaafiloon ^qTrans107


Verily, as for those who do not believe that they are destined to meet Us, but content themselves with the life of this world and do not look beyond it, and are heedless of Our messages - ^qAsad107


Lo! those who expect not the meeting with Us but desire the life of the world and feel secure therein, and those who are neglectful of Our revelations, ^qPickthall107


Surely those who look not to encounter Us and are well-pleased with the present life and are at rest in it, and those who are heedless of Our signs, ^qArberry107

Ulaaa'ika maawaahumun Naaru bimaa kaanoo yaksiboon ^qTrans108


their goal is the fire in return for all [the evil] that they were wont to do. ^qAsad108


Their home will be the Fire because of what they used to earn. ^qPickthall108


those -- their refuge is the Fire, for that they have been earning. ^qArberry108

Innal lazeena aamanoo wa 'amilus saalihaati yahdeehim Rabbuhum bi eemaanihim tajree min tahtihimul anhaaru fee jannaatin Na'eem ^qTrans109


[But,] verily, as for those who have attained to faith and do righteous deeds - their Sustainer guides them aright by means of their faith. [In the life to come,] running waters will flow at their feet in gardens of bliss; ^qAsad109


Lo! those who believe and do good works, their Lord guideth them by their faith. Rivers will flow beneath them in the Gardens of Delight, ^qPickthall109


Surely those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, their Lord will guide them for their belief; beneath them rivers flowing in gardens of bliss; ^qArberry109

Da'waahum feehaa Subbaanakal laahumma wa tahiyyatuhum feehaa salaam; wa aakhiru da'waahum anil hamdu lillaahi Rabbil 'aalameen ^qTrans1010


[and] in that [state of happiness] they will call out, "Limitless art Thou in Thy glory, O God!"-and will be answered with the greeting, "Peace!" And their call will close with [the words], "All praise is due to God, the Sustainer of all the worlds!" ^qAsad1010


Their prayer therein will be: Glory be to Thee, O Allah! and their greeting therein will be: Peace. And the conclusion of their prayer will be: Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds! ^qPickthall1010


their cry therein, 'Glory to Thee, O God,' their greeting, 'Peace,' and their cry ends, 'Praise belongs to God, the Lord of all Being.' ^qArberry1010

Wa law yu'aijilul laahu linnaasish sharras ti'jaalahum bilkhairi laqudiya ilaihim ajaluhum fanazarul lazeena laa yarjoona liqaaa'anna fee tughyaanihim ya'mahoon ^qTrans1011


NOW IF GOD were to hasten for human beings the ill [which they deserve by their sinning] in the same manner as they [themselves] would hasten [the coming to them of what they consider to be] good, their end would indeed come forthwith! But We leave them alone [for a while] -all those who do not believe that they are destined to meet Us: [We leave them alone] in their overweening arrogance, blindly stumbling to and fro. ^qAsad1011


If Allah were to hasten on for men the ill (that they have earned) as they would hasten on the good, their respite would already have expired. But We suffer those who look not for the meeting with Us to wander blindly on in their contumacy. ^qPickthall1011


If God should hasten unto men evil as they would hasten good, their term would be already decided for them. But We leave those, who look not to encounter Us, in their insolence wandering blindly. ^qArberry1011

Wa izaa massal insaanad durru da'aanaa lijambiheee aw qaa'idan aw qaaa'iman falammaa kashafnaa 'anhu durrahoo marra ka al lam yad'unaaa ilaa durrim massah; kazaalika zuyyina lilmusrifeena maa kaanoo ya'maloon ^qTrans1012


For [thus it is:] when affliction befalls man, he cries out unto Us, whether he be lying on his side or sitting or standing; but as soon as We have freed him of his affliction, he goes on as though he had never invoked Us to save him from the affliction that befell him! Thus do their own doings seem goodly unto those who waste their own selves. ^qAsad1012


And if misfortune touch a man he crieth unto Us, (while reclining) on his side, or sitting or standing, but when We have relieved him of the misfortune he goeth his way as though he had not cried unto Us because of a misfortune that afflicted him. Thus is what they do made (seeming) fair unto the prodigal. ^qPickthall1012


When affliction visits a man, he calls Us on his side, or sitting, or standing; but when We have removed his affliction from him, he passes on, as if he never called Us to an affliction that visited him. So decked out fair to the prodigal is that they have been doing. ^qArberry1012

Wa laqad ahlaknal quroona min qablikum lammaa zalamoo wa jaaa'at hum Rusuluhum bil baiyinaati wa maa kaanoo liyu'minoo; kazaalika najzil qawmal mujrimeen ^qTrans1013


And, indeed, We destroyed before your time [whole] generations when they [persistently] did evil although the apostles sent unto them brought them all evidence of the truth; for they refused to believe [them]. Thus do We requite people who are lost in sin. ^qAsad1013


We destroyed the generations before you when they did wrong; and their messengers (from Allah) came unto them with clear proofs (of His Sovereignty) but they would not believe. Thus do We reward the guilty folk. ^qPickthall1013


We destroyed the generations before you when they did evil, and their Messengers came to them with the clear signs, but they would not believe; so We recompense the people of the sinners. ^qArberry1013

# 14

Summa ja'alnaakum khalaaa'ifa fil ardi mim ba'dihim linanzura kaifa ta'maloon ^qTrans1014


And thereupon We made you their successors on earth, so that We might behold how you act. ^qAsad1014


Then We appointed you viceroys in the earth after them, that We might see how ye behave. ^qPickthall1014


Then We appointed you viceroys in the earth after them, that We might behold how you would do. ^qArberry1014

Wa izaa tutlaa 'alaihim aayaatunaa baiyinaatin qaalal lazeena laa yarjoona liqaaa'ana'ti bi Quraanin ghairi haazaaa aw baddilh; qul maa yakoonu leee an ubaddilahoo min tilqaaa'i nafsee in attabi'u illaa maa yoohaaa ilaiya inneee akhaafu in 'asaytu Rabbee 'azaaba Yawmin 'Azeeem ^qTrans1015


AND [thus it is:] whenever Our messages are conveyed unto them in all their clarity, those who do not believe that they are destined to meet Us [are wont to] say, "Bring us a discourse other than this, or alter this one.” Say [O Prophet]: "It is not conceivable that I should alter it of my own volition; I only follow what is revealed to me. Behold, I would dread, were I [thus] to rebel against my Sustainer, the suffering [which would befall me] on that awesome Day [of Judgment]!" ^qAsad1015


And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them, they who look not for the meeting with Us say: Bring a Lecture other than this, or change it. Say (O Muhammad): It is not for me to change it of my accord. I only follow that which is inspired in me. Lo! if I disobey my Lord I fear the retribution of an awful Day. ^qPickthall1015


And when Our signs are recited to them, clear signs, those who look not to encounter Us say, 'Bring a Koran other than this, or alter it.' Say: 'It is not for me to alter it of my own accord. I follow nothing, except what is revealed to me. Truly I fear, if I should rebel against my Lord, the chastisement of a dreadful day.' ^qArberry1015

Qul law shaaa'al laahu maa talawtuhoo 'alaikum wa laaa adraakum bihee faqad labistu feekum 'umuram min qablih; afalaa ta'qiloon ^qTrans1016


Say: "Had God willed it [otherwise], I would not have conveyed this [divine writ] unto you, nor would He have brought it to your knowledge. Indeed. a whole lifetime have I dwelt among you ere this [revelation came unto me]: will you not, then, use your reason?” ^qAsad1016


Say: If Allah had so willed I should not have recited it to you nor would He have made it known to you. I dwelt among you a whole lifetime before it (came to me). Have ye then no sense? ^qPickthall1016


Say: 'Had God willed I would not have recited it to you, neither would He have taught you it; I abode among you a lifetime before it -- will you not understand?' ^qArberry1016

# 17

Faman azlamu mimmanif taraa 'alal laahi kaziban aw kazzaba bi Aayaatih; innahoo laa yuflihul mujrimoon ^qTrans1017


And who could be more wicked than they who attribute their own lying inventions to God or give the lie to His messages? Verily, those who are lost in sin will never attain to a happy state - ^qAsad1017


Who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah and denieth His revelations? Lo! the guilty never are successful. ^qPickthall1017


And who does greater evil than he who forges against God a lie, or cries lies to His signs? Surely the sinners do not prosper. ^qArberry1017

# 18

Wa ya'budoona min doonil laahi maa laa yadurruhum wa laa yanfa'uhum wa yaqooloona haaa'ulaaa'i shufa'aaa 'unaa 'indal laah; qul atunabbi 'oonal laaha bima laa ya'lamu fis samaawaati wa laa fil ard; subhaanahoo wa Ta'aalaa 'ammaa yushrikoon ^qTrans1018


and [neither will] they [who] worship, side by side with God, things or beings that can neither harm nor benefit them, saying [to themselves], "These are our intercessors with God!" Say: "Do you [think that you could] inform God of anything in the heavens or on earth that He does not know? Limitless is He in His glory, and sublimely exalted above anything to which men may ascribe a share in His divinity!" ^qAsad1018


They worship beside Allah that which neither hurteth them nor profiteth them, and they say: These are our intercessors with Allah. Say: Would ye inform Allah of (something) that He knoweth not in the heavens or in the earth? Praised be He and High Exalted above all that ye associate (with Him)! ^qPickthall1018


They serve, apart from God, what hurts them not neither profits them, and they say, 'These are our intercessors with God.' Say: 'Will you tell God what He knows not either in the heavens or in the earth?' Glory be to Him! High be He exalted above that they associate! ^qArberry1018

# 19

Wa maa kaanan naasu illaaa ummmatanw waahidatan fakh talafoo; wa law laa kalimatun sabaqat mir Rabbika laqudiya bainahum fee maa feehi yakhtalifoon ^qTrans1019


AND [know that] all mankind were once but one single community, and only later did they begin to hold divergent views. And had it not been for a decree- that had already gone forth from thy Sustainer, all their differences would indeed have been settled [from the outset]. ^qAsad1019


Mankind were but one community; then they differed; and had it not been for a word that had already gone forth from thy Lord it had been judged between them in respect of that wherein they differ. ^qPickthall1019


Mankind were only one nation, then they fell into variance. But for a word that preceded from thy Lord, it had been decided between them already touching their differences. ^qArberry1019

# 20

W yaqooloona law laaa unzila 'alaihi aayatum mir Rabbihee faqul innamal ghaibu lillaahi fantaziroo innee ma'akum minal muntazireen ^qTrans1020


NOW THEY [who deny the truth] are wont to ask, "Why has no miraculous sign ever been bestowed upon him from on high by his Sustainer?" Say, then: "God's alone is the knowledge of that which. is beyond the reach of human perception. Wait, then, [until His will becomes manifest:] verily, I shall wait with you!" ^qAsad1020


And they will say: If only a portent were sent down upon him from his Lord! Then say, (O Muhammad): The Unseen belongeth to Allah. So wait! Lo! I am waiting with you. ^qPickthall1020


They say, 'Why has a sign not been sent down upon him from his Lord?' Say: 'The Unseen belongs only to God. Then watch and wait; I shall be with you watching and waiting.' ^qArberry1020

And [thus it is:] whenever We let [such] people taste [some of Our] grace after hardship has visited them-lo! they forthwith turn to devising false arguments against Our messages. Say: "God is swifter [than you] in His deep devising!" Behold, Our [heavenly] messengers are recording all that you may devise! ^qAsad1021


And when We cause mankind to taste of mercy after some adversity which had afflicted them, behold! they have some plot against Our revelations. Say: Allah is more swift in plotting. Lo! Our messengers write down that which ye plot. ^qPickthall1021


When We let the people taste mercy after hardship has visited them, lo, they have a device concerning Our signs. Say: 'God is swifter at devising; surely Our messengers are writing down what you are devising.' ^qArberry1021

He it is who enables you to travel on land and sea. And [behold what happens] when you go to sea in ships: [they go to sea in ships,] and they sail on in them in a favourable wind, and they rejoice thereat until there comes upon them a tempest, and waves surge towards them from all sides, so that they believe themselves to be encompassed [by death; and then] they call unto God, [at that moment] sincere in their faith in Him alone, "If Thou wilt but save us from this, we shall most certainly be among the grateful!" ^qAsad1022


He it is Who maketh you to go on the land and the sea till, when ye are in the ships and they sail with them with a fair breeze and they are glad therein, a storm-wind reacheth them and the wave cometh unto them from every side and they deem that they are overwhelmed therein; (then) they cry unto Allah, making their faith pure for Him only: If Thou deliver us from this, we truly will be of the thankful. ^qPickthall1022


It is He who conveys you on the land and the sea; and when you are in the ship -- and the ships run with them with a fair breeze, and they rejoice in it, there comes upon them a strong wind, and waves come on them from every side, and they think they are encompassed; they call upon God, making their religion His sincerely: 'If Thou deliverest us from these, surely we shall be among the thankful.' ^qArberry1022

Yet as soon as He has saved them from this [danger], lo! they behave outrageously on earth, offending against all right! O men! All your outrageous deeds are bound to fall back upon your own selves! [You care only for] the enjoyment of life in this world: [but remember that] in the end unto Us you must return, whereupon We shall make you truly understand all that you were doing [in life]. ^qAsad1023


Yet when He hath delivered them, behold! they rebel in the earth wrongfully. O mankind! Your rebellion is only against yourselves. (Ye have) enjoyment of the life of the world; then unto Us is your return and We shall proclaim unto you what ye used to do. ^qPickthall1023


Nevertheless when He has delivered them behold, they are insolent in the earth, wrongfully. O men, your insolence is only against yourselves; the enjoyment of this present life, then unto Us you shall return, then We shall tell you what you were doing. ^qArberry1023

The parable of the life of this world is but that of rain which We send down from the sky, and which is absorbed by the plants of the earth whereof men and animals draw nourishment, until -when the earth has assumed its artful adornment and has been embellished, and they who dwell on it believe that they have gained mastery over it -there comes down upon it Our judgment, by night or by day, and We cause it to become [like] a field mown down, as if there had been no yesterday. Thus clearly do We spell out these messages unto people who think! ^qAsad1024


The similitude of the life of the world is only as water which We send down from the sky, then the earth's growth of that which men and cattle eat mingleth with it till, when the earth hath taken on her ornaments and is embellished, and her people deem that they are masters of her, Our commandment cometh by night or by day and We make it as reaped corn as if it had not flourished yesterday. Thus do we expound the revelations for people who reflect. ^qPickthall1024


The likeness of this present life is as water that We send down out of heaven, and the plants of the earth mingle with it whereof men and cattle eat, till, when the earth has taken on its glitter and has decked itself fair, and its inhabitants think they have power over it, Our command comes upon it by night or day, and We make it stubble, as though yesterday it flourished not. Even so We distinguish the signs for a people who reflect. ^qArberry1024

And Allah summoneth to the abode of peace, and leadeth whom He will to a straight path. ^qPickthall1025


And God summons to the Abode of Peace, and He guides whomsoever He will to to a straight path; ^qArberry1025

For those who persevere in doing good there is the ultimate good in store, and more [than that]. No darkness and no ignominy will overshadow their faces [on Resurrection Day]: it is they who are destined for paradise, therein to abide. ^qAsad1026


For those who do good is the best (reward) and more (thereto). Neither dust nor ignominy cometh near their faces. Such are rightful owners of the Garden; they will abide therein. ^qPickthall1026


the good-doers the reward most fair and a surplus; neither dust nor abasement shall overspread their faces. Those are the inhabitants of Paradise, therein dwelling forever. ^qArberry1026

But us for those who have done evil deeds - the recompense of an evil, deed shall be the like thereof: and - since they will have none to defend them against God - ignominy will overshadow them as though their faces were veiled by the night's own darkness: it is they who are destined for the fire. therein to abide. ^qAsad1027


And those who earn ill-deeds, (for them) requital of each ill-deed by the like thereof; and ignominy overtaketh them - They have no protector from Allah - as if their faces had been covered with a cloak of darkest night. Such are rightful owners of the Fire; they will abide therein. ^qPickthall1027


And for those who have earned evil deeds the recompense of an evil deed shall be the like of it; abasement shall overspread them, neither have they any defender from God, as if their faces were covered with strips of night shadowy. Those are the inhabitants of the Fire, therein dwelling forever. ^qArberry1027

For, one Day We shall gather them all together, and then We shall say unto those who [in their lifetime] ascribed divinity to aught but God, "Stand where you are, you and those [beings and powers] to whom you were wont to ascribe a share in God's divinity! -for by then We shall have [visibly] separated them from one another. And the beings to whom they had ascribed a share in God's divinity will say [to those who had worshipped them], "It was not us that you were wont to worship; ^qAsad1028


On the day when We gather them all together, then We say unto those who ascribed partners (unto Us): Stand back, ye and your (pretended) partners (of Allah)! And We separate them, the one from the other, and their (pretended) partners say: It was not us ye worshipped. ^qPickthall1028


And the day We shall muster them all, then We shall say to those who associate other gods with God: 'Get you to your place, you and your associates!' Then We shall set a space between them, and their associates will say, 'Not us you were serving. ^qArberry1028

For, alas, there has never yet been any community that attained to faith [in its entirety,] and thereupon benefited by its faith, except the people of Jonah. When they came to believe, We removed from them the suffering of disgrace [which otherwise would have befallen them even] in the life of this world, and allowed them to enjoy their life during the time allotted to them. ^qAsad1098


If only there had been a community (of all those that were destroyed of old) that believed and profited by its belief as did the folk of Jonah! When they believed We drew off from them the torment of disgrace in the life of the world and gave them comfort for a while. ^qPickthall1098


Why was there never a city that believed, and its belief profited it? -- Except the people of Jonah; when they believed, We removed from them the chastisement of degradation in this present life, and We gave unto them enjoyment for a time. ^qArberry1098

Wa law shaaa'a Rabbuka la aamana man fil ardi kulluhum jamee'aa; afa anta tukrihun naasa hattaa yakoonoo mu'mineen ^qTrans1099


And [thus it is:] had thy Sustainer so willed, all those who live on earth would surely have attained to faith, all of them: dost thou, then, think that thou couldst compel people to believe, ^qAsad1099


And if thy Lord willed, all who are in the earth would have believed together. Wouldst thou (Muhammad) compel men until they are believers? ^qPickthall1099


And if thy Lord had willed, whoever is in the earth would have believed, all of them, all together. Wouldst thou then constrain the people, until they are believers? ^qArberry1099

Wa maa kaana linafsin an tu'mina illaa bi iznil laah; wa yaj'alur rijsa 'alal lazeena laa ya'qiloon ^qTrans10100


notwithstanding that no human being can ever attain to faith otherwise than by God's leave, and [that] it is He who lays the loathsome evil [of disbelief] upon those who will not use -their reason? ^qAsad10100


It is not for any soul to believe save by the permission of Allah. He hath set uncleanness upon those who have no sense. ^qPickthall10100


It is not for any soul to believe save by the leave of God; and He lays abomination upon those who have no understanding. ^qArberry10100

Say: "Consider whatever there is in the heavens and on earth!" But of what avail could all the messages and all the warnings be to people who will not believe? ^qAsad10101


Say: Behold what is in the heavens and the earth! But revelations and warnings avail not folk who will not believe. ^qPickthall10101


Say: 'Behold what is in the heavens and in the earth!' But neither signs nor warnings avail a people who do not believe. ^qArberry10101

Can such, then, expect anything else [to befall them] but the like of the days of [calamity which befell] those [deniers of the truth] who passed away before them? Say: "Wait, then, [for what will happen) verily, I shall wait with you!" ^qAsad10102


What expect they save the like of the days of those who passed away before them? Say: Expect then! I am with you among the expectant. ^qPickthall10102


So do they watch and wait for aught but the like of the days of those who passed away before them? Say: 'Then watch and wait; I shall be with you watching and waiting.' ^qArberry10102

Summma nunajjee Ruslanaa wallazeena aamanoo; kazaalika haqqan 'alainaa nunjil mu'mineen ^qTrans10103


[For thus it always happens: We seal the doom of all who deny the truth and give the lie to Our messages;] and thereupon We save Our apostles and those who have attained to faith. Thus have We willed it upon Ourselves: We save all who believe [in Us], ^qAsad10103


Then shall We save Our messengers and the believers, in like manner (as of old). It is incumbent upon Us to save believers. ^qPickthall10103


Then We shall deliver Our Messengers and the believers. Even so, as is Our bounden duty, We shall deliver the believers. ^qArberry10103

SAY [O Prophet]: "O mankind! If you are in doubt as to what my faith is, then [know that] I do not worship those beings whom you worship beside God, but [that] I worship God alone, who shall cause you [all] to die: for I have been bidden to be among those who believe [in Him alone]." ^qAsad10104


Say (O Muhammad): O mankind! If ye are in doubt of my religion, then (know that) I worship not those whom ye worship instead of Allah, but I worship Allah Who causeth you to die, and I have been commanded to be of the believers. ^qPickthall10104


Say: 'O men, if you are in doubt regarding my religion, I serve not those you serve apart from God, but I serve God, who will gather you to Him, and I am commanded to be of the believers, and: ^qArberry10104

Wa an aqim wajhaka liddeeni Haneefanw wa laa takoonannna minal mushrikeen ^qTrans10105


Hence, [O man,] set thy face steadfastly towards the [true] faith, turning away from all that is false, and be not among those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God. ^qAsad10105


And, (O Muhammad) set thy purpose resolutely for religion, as a man by nature upright, and be not of those who ascribe partners (to Allah). ^qPickthall10105


"Set thy face to the religion, a man of pure faith, and be thou not of the idolaters; ^qArberry10105

Wa laa tad'u min doonil laahi maa laa yanfa'uka wa laa yadurruka fa in fa'alta fa innaka izam minaz zaalimeen ^qTrans10106


Thus, do not invoke, side by side with God, anything that can neither benefit thee nor harm thee: for, behold, if thou do it, thou wilt surely be among the evildoers! ^qAsad10106


And cry not, beside Allah, unto that which cannot profit thee nor hurt thee, for if thou didst so then wert thou of the wrong-doers. ^qPickthall10106


and do not call, apart from God, on that which neither profits nor hurts thee, for if thou dost, then thou wilt surely be of the evildoers. ^qArberry10106

And [know that] if God should touch thee with misfortune, there is none who could remove it save Him; and if He intends good for thee, there is none who could turn away His bounty: He causes it to alight upon whomsoever He wills of His servants. And He alone is truly forgiving, truly a dispenser of grace. ^qAsad10107


If Allah afflicteth thee with some hurt, there is none who can remove it save Him; and if He desireth good for thee, there is none who can repel His bounty. He striketh with it whom He will of his bondmen. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. ^qPickthall10107


And if God visits thee with affliction, none can remove it but He; and if He desires any good for thee, none can repel His bounty; He causes it to fall upon whomsoever He will of His servants." He is the All-forgiving, the All-compassionate.' ^qArberry10107

SAY [O Prophet]: "O mankind! The truth from your Sustainer has now come unto you. Whoever, therefore, chooses to follow the right path, follows it but for his own good; and whoever chooses to go astray, goes but astray to his own hurt. And I am not responsible for your conduct." ^qAsad10108


Say: O mankind! Now hath the Truth from your Lord come unto you. So whosoever is guided, is guided only for (the good of) his soul, and whosoever erreth erreth only against it. And I am not a warder over you. ^qPickthall10108


Say: 'O men, the truth has come to you from your Lord. Whosoever is guided is guided only to his own gain, and whosoever goes astray, it is only to his own loss. I am not a guardian over you. ^qArberry10108

And [as for thyself, O Muhammad,] follow but what is being revealed unto thee, and be patient in adversity, until God shall give His judgment: for He is the best of all judges. ^qAsad10109


And (O Muhammad) follow that which is inspired in thee, and forbear until Allah give judgment. And He is the Best of Judges. ^qPickthall10109


And follow thou what is revealed to thee; and be thou patient until God shall judge; and He is the best of judges. ^qArberry10109
