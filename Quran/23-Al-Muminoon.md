But the great ones among his people, who refused to acknowledge the truth, replied: “This [man] is nothing but a mortal like yourselves who wants to make himself superior to you! For, if God had willed [to convey a message unto us], He would surely have sent down angels; [moreover,] we have never heard [any­thing like] this from our forebears of old! ^qAsad2324


But the chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved, said: This is only a mortal like you who would make himself superior to you. Had Allah willed, He surely could have sent down angels. We heard not of this in the case of our fathers of old. ^qPickthall2324


Said the Council of the unbelievers of his people, 'This is naught but a mortal like yourselves, who desires to gain superiority over you. And if God willed, He would have sent down angels. We never heard of this among, our fathers, the ancients. ^qArberry2324

Thereupon We inspired him thus: “Build, un­der Our eyes and according to Our inspiration, the ark [that shall save thee and those who follow thee]. And when Our judgment comes to pass, and waters gush forth in torrents over the face of the earth, place on board of this [ark] one pair of each [kind of animal] of either sex, as well as thy family - excepting those on whom sentence has already been passed; and do not appeal to Me [any more] in behalf of those who are bent on evildoing - for, behold, they are destined to be drowned! ^qAsad2327


Then We inspired in him, saying: Make the ship under Our eyes and Our inspiration. Then, when Our command cometh and the oven gusheth water, introduce therein of every (kind) two spouses, and thy household save him thereof against whom the Word hath already gone forth. And plead not with Me on behalf of those who have done wrong. Lo! they will be drowned. ^qPickthall2327


Then We said to him, 'Make thou the Ark under Our eyes and as We reveal, and then, when Our command comes and the Oven boils, insert in it two of every kind and thy, family -- except for him against whom the word already has been spoken; and address Me not concerning those who have done evil; they shall be drowned. ^qArberry2327

# 28

Fa izas tawaita ata wa mam ma'aka 'alal fulki faqulil hamdu lillaahil lazee najjaanaa minal qawmiz zalimeen ^qTrans2328


“And as soon as thou and those who are with thee are settled in the ark, say: ‘All praise is due to God, who has saved us from those evildoing folk!’ ^qAsad2328


And when thou art on board the ship, thou and whoso is with thee, then say: Praise be to Allah Who hath saved us from the wrongdoing folk! ^qPickthall2328


Then, when thou art seated in the Ark and those with thee, say, "Praise belongs to God, who has delivered us from the people of the evildoers." ^qArberry2328

# 29

Wa qur Rabbi anzilnee munzalam mubaarakanw wa Anta khairul munzileen ^qTrans2329


“And say: ‘O my Sustainer! Cause me to reach a destination blessed [by Thee] for Thou art the best to show man how to reach his [true] destination!’” ^qAsad2329


And say: My Lord! Cause me to land at a blessed landing-place, for Thou art Best of all who bring to land. ^qPickthall2329


And say, "'O my Lord, do Thou harbour me in a blessed harbour, for Thou art the best of harbourers." ^qArberry2329

# 30

Inna fee zaalika la Aayaatinw wa in kunnaa lamubtaleen ^qTrans2330


In this [story], behold, there are messages indeed [for those who think]: for, verily, We always put [man] to a test. ^qAsad2330


Lo! herein verily are portents, for lo! We are ever putting (mankind) to the test. ^qPickthall2330


Surely in that are signs, and surely We put to the test. ^qArberry2330

# 31

Summaa anshaana mim ba'dihim qarnan aakhareen ^qTrans2331


AND AFTER those [people of old] We gave rise to new generations; ^qAsad2331


Then, after them, We brought forth another generation; ^qPickthall2331


Thereafter, after them, We produced another generation, ^qArberry2331

# 32

Fa arsalnaa feehim Rasoolam minhum ani'budul laaha maa lakum min ilaahin ghairuhoo afalaa tattaqoon ^qTrans2332


and [every time] We sent unto them an apostle from among themselves, [he told them:] “Worship God [alone]: you have no deity other than Him. Will you not, then, become conscious of Him?” ^qAsad2332


And we sent among them a messenger of their own, saying: Serve Allah, Ye have no other Allah save Him. Will ye not ward off (evil)? ^qPickthall2332


and We sent amongst them a Messenger of themselves, saying, 'Serve God! You have no god other than He. Will you not be godfearing?' ^qArberry2332

And [every time] the great ones among his people, who refused to acknowledge the truth and gave the lie to the announcement of a life to come - [simply] because We had granted them ease and plenty in [their] worldly life, and they had become corrupted by it [every time] they would say: “This [man] is nothing hut a mortal like yourselves, eating of what you eat, and drinking of what you drink: ^qAsad2333


And the chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the Hereafter, and whom We had made soft in the life of the world, said: This is only a mortal like you, who eateth of that whereof ye eat and drinketh of that ye drink. ^qPickthall2333


Said the Council of the unbelievers of his people, who cried lies to the encounter of the world to come, and to whom We had given ease in the present' life, 'This is naught but a mortal like yourselves, who eats of what you eat and drinks of what you drink. ^qArberry2333

# 34

Wa la'in at'atum basharam mislakum innakum izal lakhaasiroon ^qTrans2334


and, indeed, if you pay heed to a mortal like your­selves, you will surely be the losers! ^qAsad2334


If ye were to obey a mortal like yourselves, then, lo! ye surely would be losers. ^qPickthall2334


If you obey a mortal like yourselves, then you will be losers. ^qArberry2334

# 35

A-Ya'idukum annakum izaa mittum wa kuntum turaabanw wa izaaman annakum mukhrajoon ^qTrans2335


Does he promise you that, after you have died and become [mere] dust and bones, you shall be brought forth [to a new life]? ^qAsad2335


Doth he promise you that you, when ye are dead and have become dust and bones, will (again) be brought forth? ^qPickthall2335


What, does he promise you that when you are dead, and become dust and bones, you shall be brought forth? ^qArberry2335

# 36

Haihaata haihaata limaa too'adoon ^qTrans2336


Far-fetched, far-fetched indeed is what you are promised! ^qAsad2336


Begone, begone, with that which ye are promised! ^qPickthall2336


Away, away with that you are promised! ^qArberry2336

# 37

In hiya illaa hayaatunad dunyaa namootu wa nahyaa wa maa nahnu bimab'ooseen ^qTrans2337


There is no life beyond our life in this world: we die and we live [but once], and we shall never be raised from the dead! ^qAsad2337


There is naught but our life of the world; we die and we live, and we shall not be raised (again). ^qPickthall2337


There is nothing but our present life; we die, and we live, and we shall not be raised up. ^qArberry2337

# 38

In huwa illaa rajulunif taraa 'alal laahi kazibanw wa maa nahnuu lahoo bimu'mineen ^qTrans2338


He is nothing but a man who attributes his own lying in­ventions to God, and we are not going to believe him!” ^qAsad2338


He is only a man who hath invented a lie about Allah. We are not going to put faith in him. ^qPickthall2338


He is naught but a man who has forged against God a lie, and we will not believe him.' ^qArberry2338

# 39

Qaala Rabbin surnee bimaa kazzaboon ^qTrans2339


[Whereupon the prophet] would say: “O my Sustainer! Succour me against their accusation of lying!” ^qAsad2339


He said: My Lord! Help me because they deny me. ^qPickthall2339

He said: In a little while they surely will become repentant. ^qPickthall2340


He said, 'In a little they will be remorseful.' ^qArberry2340

Fa akhazat humus saihatu bilhaqqi faja'alnaahum ghusaaa'aa; fabu;dal lilqaw miz zaalimeen ^qTrans2341


And then the blast [of Our punishment] over­took them, justly and unavoidably, and We caused them to become as the flotsam of dead leaves and the scum borne on the surface of a torrent: and so - away with those evildoing folk! ^qAsad2341


So the (Awful) Cry overtook them rightfully, and We made them like as wreckage (that a torrent hurleth). A far removal for wrongdoing folk! ^qPickthall2341


And the Cry seized them justly, and We made them as scum; so away with the people of the evildoers! ^qArberry2341

[for,] no community can ever forestall [the end of] its term - and neither can they delay [its coming]. ^qAsad2343


No nation can outstrip its term, nor yet postpone it. ^qPickthall2343


no nation outstrips its term, nor do they put it back. ^qArberry2343

And We sent forth Our apostles, one after another: [and] every time their apostle came to a community, they gave him the lie: and so We caused them to follow one another [into the grave], and let them become [mere] tales: and so - away with the folk who would not believe! ^qAsad2344


Then We sent our messengers one after another. Whenever its messenger came unto a nation they denied him; so We caused them to follow one another (to disaster) and We made them bywords. A far removal for folk who believe not! ^qPickthall2344


Then sent We Our Messengers successively; whenever its Messenger came to a nation they cried him lies, so We caused some of them to follow others, and We made them as but tales; so away with a people who do not believe! ^qArberry2344

unto Pharaoh and his great ones; but these behaved with arrogance, for they were people wont to glorify [only] themselves. ^qAsad2346


Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they scorned (them) and they were despotic folk. ^qPickthall2346


unto Pharaoh and his Council; but they waxed proud, and they were a lofty people, ^qArberry2346

# 47

Faqaaloo annu'minu libasharaini mislinaa wa qawmuhumaa lanaa 'aabidoon ^qTrans2347


And so they said: “Shall we believe [them] two mortals like ourselves - although their people are our slaves?” ^qAsad2347


And they said: Shall we put faith in two mortals like ourselves, and whose folk are servile unto us? ^qPickthall2347

Thus, they gave the lie to those two, and earned (thereby) their place among the doomed: ^qAsad2348


So they denied them, and became of those who were destroyed. ^qPickthall2348


So they cried them lies, and they were among the destroyed. ^qArberry2348

# 49
