SAY: "It has been revealed to me that some of the unseen beings gave ear [to this divine writ], and thereupon said [unto their fellow-beings]: "'Verily, we have heard a wondrous discourse, ^qAsad721


Say (O Muhammad): It is revealed unto me that a company of the Jinn gave ear, and they said: Lo! we have heard a marvellous Qur'an, ^qPickthall721

Yahdeee ilar rushdi fa aamannaa bihee wa lan nushrika bi rabbinaaa ahadaa ^qTrans722


guiding towards consciousness of what is right; and so We have come to believe in it. And we shall never ascribe divinity to anyone beside our Sustainer, ^qAsad722


Which guideth unto righteousness, so we believe in it and we ascribe no partner unto our Lord. ^qPickthall722


guiding to rectitude. We believe in it, and we will not associate with our Lord anyone. ^qArberry722

# 3

Wa annahoo Ta'aalaa jaddu Rabbinaa mat takhaza saahibatanw wa la waladaa ^qTrans723


for [we know] that sublimely exalted is our Sustainer's majesty: no consort has He ever taken unto Himself, nor a son! ^qAsad723


And (we believe) that He - exalted be the glory of our Lord! - hath taken neither wife nor son, ^qPickthall723


He -- exalted be our Lord's majesty! has not taken to Himself either consort or a son. ^qArberry723

# 4

Wa annahoo kaana yaqoolu safeehunaa 'alal laahi shatataa ^qTrans724


"'And [now we know] that the foolish among us were wont to say outrageous things about God, ^qAsad724


And that the foolish one among us used to speak concerning Allah an atrocious lie. ^qPickthall724


The fool among us spoke against God outrage, ^qArberry724

# 5

Wa annaa zanannaaa al lan taqoolal insu wal jinnu 'alal laahi kazibaa ^qTrans725


and that [we were mistaken when] we thought that neither man nor [any of] the invisible forces would ever tell a lie about God. ^qAsad725


And lo! we had supposed that humankind and jinn would not speak a lie concerning Allah - ^qPickthall725


and we had thought that men and jinn would never speak against God a lie. ^qArberry725

# 6

Wa annahoo kaana rijaa lum minal insi ya'oozoona birijaalim minal jinni fazaa doohum rahaqaa ^qTrans726


Yet [it has always happened] that certain kinds of humans would seek refuge with certain kinds of [such] invisible forces: but these only increased their confusion – ^qAsad726


And indeed (O Muhammad) individuals of humankind used to invoke the protection of individuals of the jinn, so that they increased them in revolt against Allah); ^qPickthall726


But there were certain men of mankind who would take refuge with certain men of the jinn, and they increased them in vileness, ^qArberry726

# 7

Wa annahum zannoo kamaa zanantum al lany yab'asal laahu ahadaa ^qTrans727


so much so that they came to think, as you [once] thought, that God would never [again] send forth anyone [as His apostle]. ^qAsad727


And indeed they supposed, even as ye suppose, that Allah would not raise anyone (from the dead) - ^qPickthall727


and they thought, even as you also thought, that God would never raise up anyone. ^qArberry727

# 8

Wa annaa lamasnas sa maaa'a fa wajadnaahaa muli'at harasan shadeedanw wa shuhubaa ^qTrans728


"'And [so it happened] that we reached out towards heaven: but we found it filled with mighty guards and flames, ^qAsad728


And (the Jinn who had listened to the Qur'an said): We had sought the heaven but had found it filled with strong warders and meteors. ^qPickthall728


And we stretched towards heaven, but we found it filled with terrible guards and meteors. ^qArberry728

# 9

Wa annaa kunnaa naq'udu minhaa maqaa'ida lis'sam'i famany yastami'il aana yajid lahoo shihaabar rasada ^qTrans729


notwithstanding that we were established in positions [which we had thought well-suited] to listening to [whatever secrets might be in] it: and anyone who now [or ever] tries to listen will [likewise] find a flame lying in wait for him! ^qAsad729


And we used to sit on places (high) therein to listen. But he who listeneth now findeth a flame in wait for him; ^qPickthall729


We would sit there on seats to hear; but any listening now finds a meteor in wait for him. ^qArberry729

# 10

Wa annaa laa nadreee asharrun ureeda biman fil ardi am araada bihim rabbuhum rashadaa ^qTrans7210


"'And [now we have become aware] that we [created beings] may not know whether evil fortune is intended for [any of] those who live on earth, or whether it is their Sustainer’s will to endow them with consciousness of what is right: ^qAsad7210


And we know not whether harm is boded unto all who are in the earth, or whether their Lord intendeth guidance for them. ^qPickthall7210


And so we know not whether evil is intended for those in the earth, or whether their Lord intends for them rectitude. ^qArberry7210

# 11

Wa annaa minnas saalihoona wa minnaa doona zaalika kunnaa taraaa'ilqa qidadaa ^qTrans7211


Just as [we do not know how it happens] that some from among us are righteous, while some of us are [far] below that: we have always followed widely divergent paths. ^qAsad7211


And among us there are righteous folk and among us there are far from that. We are sects having different rules. ^qPickthall7211


And some of us are the righteous, and some of us are otherwise; we are sects differing. ^qArberry7211

# 12

Wa annaa zanannaaa al lan nu'jizal laaha fil ardi wa lan nu'jizahoo harabaa ^qTrans7212


"'And, withal, we have come to know that we can never elude God [while we live] on earth, and that we can never elude Him by escaping [from life]. ^qAsad7212


And we know that we cannot escape from Allah in the earth, nor can we escape by flight. ^qPickthall7212


Indeed, we thought that we should never be able to frustrate God in the earth, neither be able to frustrate Him by flight. ^qArberry7212

# 13

Wa annaa lammaa sami'nal hudaaa aamannaa bihee famany yu'mim bi rabbihee falaa yakhaafu bakhsanw wa laa rahaqaa ^qTrans7213


Hence, as soon as we heard this [call to His] guidance, we came to believe in it: and he who believes in his Sustainer need never have fear of loss or injustice. ^qAsad7213


And when we heard the guidance, we believed therein, and whoso believeth in his Lord, he feareth neither loss nor oppression. ^qPickthall7213


When we heard the guidance, we believed in it; and whosoever believes in his Lord, he shall fear neither paltriness nor vileness. ^qArberry7213

# 14

Wa annaa minnal muslimoona wa minnal qaasitoona faman aslama fa ulaaa'ika taharraw rashadaa ^qTrans7214


"'Yet [it is true] that among us are such as have surrendered themselves to God - just as there are among us such as have abandoned themselves to wrongdoing. Now as for those who surrender themselves to Him - it is they that have attained to consciousness of what is right; ^qAsad7214


And there are among us some who have surrendered (to Allah) and there are among us some who are unjust. And whoso hath surrendered to Allah, such have taken the right path purposefully. ^qPickthall7214


And some of us have surrendered, and some of us have deviated. Those who have surrendered sought rectitude; ^qArberry7214

# 15

Wa ammal qaasitoona fa kaanoo li jahannama hatabaa ^qTrans7215


but as for those who abandon themselves to wrongdoing - they are indeed but fuel for [the fires of] hell!’" ^qAsad7215


And as for those who are unjust, they are firewood for hell. ^qPickthall7215


but as for those who have deviated, they have become firewood for Gehenna!"' ^qArberry7215

# 16

Wa alla wis taqaamoo 'alat tareeqati la asqaynaahum maa'an ghadaqaa ^qTrans7216


[KNOW,] THEN, that if they [who have heard Our call] keep firmly to the [right] path, We shall certainly shower them with blessings abundant, ^qAsad7216


If they (the idolaters) tread the right path, We shall give them to drink of water in abundance ^qPickthall7216


Would they but go straight on the way, We would give them to drink of water copious, ^qArberry7216

# 17

Linaftinahum feeh; wa many yu'rid 'an zikri rabbihee yasluk hu 'azaaban sa'adaa ^qTrans7217


so as to test them by this means: for he who shall turn away from the remembrance of his Sustainer, him will He cause to undergo suffering most grievous. ^qAsad7217


That We may test them thereby, and whoso turneth away from the remembrance of his Lord; He will thrust him into ever-growing torment. ^qPickthall7217


that We might try them therein. And whosoever turns away from the Remembrance of his Lord, He will thrust him into chastisement rigorous. ^qArberry7217

# 18

Wa annal masaajida lillaahi falaa tad'oo ma'al laahi ahadaa ^qTrans7218


And [know] that all worship is due to God [alone]: hence, do not invoke anyone side by side with God! ^qAsad7218


And the places of worship are only for Allah, so pray not unto anyone along with Allah. ^qPickthall7218


The places of worship belong to God; so call not, along with God, upon anyone. ^qArberry7218

# 19

Wa annahoo lammaa qaama 'adul laahi yad'oohu kaadoo yakoonoona 'alaihi libadaa ^qTrans7219


Yet [thus it is] that whenever a servant of God stands up in prayer to Him, they [who are bent on denying the truth] would gladly overwhelm him with their crowds. ^qAsad7219


And when the slave of Allah stood up in prayer to Him, they crowded on him, almost stifling. ^qPickthall7219


When the servant of God stood calling on Him, they were wellnigh upon him in swarms. ^qArberry7219

# 20

Qul innamaaa ad'oo rabbee wa laaa ushriku biheee ahadaa ^qTrans7220


Say: "I invoke my Sustainer alone, for I do not ascribe divinity to anyone beside Him." ^qAsad7220


Say (unto them, O Muhammad): I pray unto Allah only, and ascribe unto Him no partner. ^qPickthall7220


Say: 'I call only upon my Lord, and I do not associate with Him anyone. ^qArberry7220

# 21

Qul innee laaa amliku lakum darranw wa laa rashadaa ^qTrans7221


Say: "Verily, it is not in my power to cause you harm or to endow you with consciousness of what is right." ^qAsad7221


Say: Lo! I control not hurt nor benefit for you. ^qPickthall7221


Say: 'Surely I possess no power over you, either for hurt or for rectitude.' ^qArberry7221

# 22

Qul innee lany yujeeranee minal laahi ahad, wa lan ajida min doonihee multahadaa ^qTrans7222


Say: "Verily, no one could ever protect me from God, nor could I ever find a place to hide from Him ^qAsad7222


Say: Lo! none can protect me from Allah, nor can I find any refuge beside Him ^qPickthall7222


Say: 'From God shall protect me not anyone, and I shall find, apart from Him, no refuge, ^qArberry7222

# 23

Illaa balaagham minal laahi wa risaalaatih; wa many ya'sil laaha wa rasoolahoo fa inna lahoo naara jahannama khaalideena feehaaa abadaa ^qTrans7223


if I should fail to convey [to the world whatever illumination comes to me] from God and His messages." Now as for him who rebels against God and His Apostle - verily, the fire of hell awaits him, therein to abide beyond the count of time. ^qAsad7223


(Mine is) but conveyance (of the Truth) from Allah, and His messages; and whoso disobeyeth Allah and His messenger, lo! his is fire of hell, wherein such dwell for ever. ^qPickthall7223


excepting a Deliverance from God and His Messages. And whoso rebels against God and His messenger, for him there awaits the Fire of Gehenna; therein they shall dwell forever.' ^qArberry7223

# 24

Hattaaa izaa ra aw maa yoo'adoona fasaya'lamoona man ad'afu naasiranw wa aqallu 'adadaa ^qTrans7224


[Let them, then, wait] until the time when they behold that [doom] of which they were forewarned: for then they will come to understand which [kind of man] is more helpless and counts for less! ^qAsad7224


Till (the day) when they shall behold that which they are promised (they may doubt); but then they will know (for certain) who is weaker in allies and less in multitude. ^qPickthall7224


Until, when they see that which they are promised, then they will know who is weaker in helpers and fewer in numbers. ^qArberry7224

# 25

Qul in adreee a qareebum maa too'adoona am yaj'alu lahoo rabbeee amadaa ^qTrans7225


Say: "I do not know whether that [doom] of which you were forewarned is near, or whether my Sustainer has set for it a distant term." ^qAsad7225


Say (O Muhammad, unto the disbelievers): I know not whether that which ye are promised is nigh, or if my Lord hath set a distant term for it. ^qPickthall7225


Say: 'I do not know whether that which you are promised is nigh, or whether my Lord will appoint for it a space; ^qArberry7225

# 26

'Aalimul ghaibi falaa yuzhiru alaa ghaibiheee ahadaa ^qTrans7226


He [alone] knows that which is beyond the reach of a created being's perception, and to none does He disclose aught of the mysteries of His Own unfathomable knowledge, ^qAsad7226


(He is) the Knower of the Unseen, and He revealeth unto none His secret, ^qPickthall7226


Knower He of the Unseen, and He discloses not His Unseen to anyone, ^qArberry7226

# 27

Illaa manir tadaa mir rasoolin fa innahoo yasluku mim baini yadihi wa min khalfihee rasadaa ^qTrans7227


unless it be to an apostle whom He has been pleased to elect [there for]: and then He sends forth [the forces of heaven] to watch over him in whatever lies open before him and in what is beyond his ken – ^qAsad7227


Save unto every messenger whom He hath chosen, and then He maketh a guard to go before him and a guard behind him ^qPickthall7227


save only to such a Messenger as He is well-pleased with; then He despatches before him and behind him watchers, ^qArberry7227

# 28

Liya'lama an qad ablaghoo risaalaati rabbihim wa ahaata bima ladihim wa ahsaa kulla shai'in 'adadaa ^qTrans7228


so as to make manifest that it is indeed [but] their Sustainer's messages that these [apostles] deliver: for it is He who encompasses [with His knowledge] all that they have [to say], just as He takes count, one by one, of everything [that exists]. ^qAsad7228


That He may know that they have indeed conveyed the messages of their Lord. He surroundeth all their doings, and He keepeth count of all things. ^qPickthall7228


that He may know they have delivered the Messages of their Lord; and He encompasses all that is with them, and He has numbered everything in numbers.' ^qArberry7228
