Huwal lazeee akharajal lazeena kafaroo min ahlil kitaabi min diyaarihim li awwalil Hashr; maa zanantum any yakhrujoo wa zannooo annahum maa ni'atuhum husoonuhum minal laahi faataahumul laahu min haisu lam yahtasiboo wa qazafa fee quloobihimur ru'ba yukhriboona bu yootahum bi aydeehim wa aydil mu'mineena fa'tabiroo yaaa ulil absaar ^qTrans592


He it is who turned out of their homes, at the time of [their] first gathering [for war], such of the followers of earlier revelation as were bent on denying the truth. You did not think [O believers] that they would depart [without resistance] - just as they thought that their strongholds would protect them against God: but God came upon them in a manner which they had not expected, and cast terror into their hearts; [and thus] they destroyed their homes by their own hands as well as the hands of the believers. Learn a lesson, then, O you who are endowed with insight! ^qAsad592


He it is Who hath caused those of the People of the Scripture who disbelieved to go forth from their homes unto the first exile. Ye deemed not that they would go forth, while they deemed that their strongholds would protect them from Allah. But Allah reached them from a place whereof they recked not, and cast terror in their hearts so that they ruined their houses with their own hands and the hands of the believers. So learn a lesson, O ye who have eyes! ^qPickthall592


It is He who expelled from their habitations the unbelievers among the People of the Book at the first mustering. You did not think that they would go forth, and they thought that their fortresses would defend them against God; then God came upon them from whence they had not reckoned, and He cast terror into their hearts as they destroyed their houses with their own hands, and the hands of the believers; therefore take heed, you who have eyes! ^qArberry592

Wa law laaa an katabal laahu 'alaihimul jalaaa'a la'azzabahum fid dunyaa wa lahum fil Aakhirati 'azaabun Naar ^qTrans593


And had it not been for God’s having ordained banishment for them, He would indeed have imposed [yet greater] suffering on them in this world: still, in the life to come there awaits them suffering through fire: ^qAsad593


And if Allah had not decreed migration for them, He verily would have punished them in the world, and theirs in the Hereafter is the punishment of the Fire. ^qPickthall593


Had God not prescribed dispersal for them, He would have chastised them in this world; and there awaits them in the world to come the chastisement of the Fire. ^qArberry593

Zaalika bi annahum shaaqqul laaha wa Rasoolahoo wa many yushaaaqqil laaha fa innal laaha shadeedul-'iqaab ^qTrans594


this, because they cut themselves off from God and His Apostle: and as for him who cuts himself off from God and His Apostle - verily, God is severe in retribution! ^qAsad594


That is because they were opposed to Allah and His messenger; and whoso is opposed to Allah, (for him) verily Allah is stern in reprisal. ^qPickthall594


That is because they made a breach with God and His Messenger; and whosoever makes a breach with God, God is terrible in retribution. ^qArberry594

Maa qata'tum mil leenatin aw taraktumoohaa qaaa'imatan'alaaa usoolihaa fabi iznil laahi wa liyukhziyal faasiqeen ^qTrans595


Whatever [of their] palm trees you may have cut down, [O believers,] or left standing on their roots, was [done] by God’s leave, and in order that He might confound the iniquitous. ^qAsad595


Whatsoever palm-trees ye cut down or left standing on their roots, it was by Allah's leave, in order that He might confound the evil-livers. ^qPickthall595


Whatever palm-trees you cut down, or left standing upon their roots, that was by God's leave, and that He might degrade the ungodly. ^qArberry595

Wa maaa afaaa'al laahu 'alaaa Rasoolihee minhum famaaa awjaftum 'alaihi min khailiinw wa laa rikaabinw wa laakinnal laaha yusallitu Rusulahoo 'alaa many yashaaa'; wallaahu 'alaa kulli shai'in Qadeer ^qTrans596


Yet [remember:] whatever [spoils taken] from the enemy God has turned over to His Apostle, you did not have to spur horse or riding-camel for its sake: but God gives His apostles mastery over whomever He wills - for God has the power to will anything. ^qAsad596


And that which Allah gave as spoil unto His messenger from them, ye urged not any horse or riding-camel for the sake thereof, but Allah giveth His messenger lordship over whom He will. Allah is Able to do all things. ^qPickthall596


And whatever spoils of war God has given unto His Messenger from them, against that you pricked neither horse nor camel; but God gives authority to His Messengers over whomsoever He will. God is powerful over everything. ^qArberry596

Maaa afaaa'al laahu 'alaa Rasoolihee min ahlil quraa falillaahi wa lir Rasooli wa lizil qurbaa wal yataamaa walmasaakeeni wabnis sabeeli kai laa yakoona doolatam bainal aghniyaaa'i minkum; wa maaa aataakumur Rasoolu fakhuzoohu wa maa nahaakum 'anhu fantahoo; wattaqul laaha innal laaha shadeedul-'iqaab ^qTrans597


Whatever [spoils taken] from the people of those villages God has turned over to His Apostle - [all of it] belongs to God and the Apostle, and the near of kin [of deceased believers], and the orphans, and the needy, and the wayfarer, so that it may not be [a benefit] going round and round among such of you as may [already] be rich. Hence, accept [willing­ly] whatever the Apostle* gives you [thereof], and refrain from [demanding] anything that he withholds from you; and remain conscious of God: for, verily, God is severe in retribution. ^qAsad597


That which Allah giveth as spoil unto His messenger from the people of the townships, it is for Allah and His messenger and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, that it become not a commodity between the rich among you. And whatsoever the messenger giveth you, take it. And whatsoever he forbiddeth, abstain (from it). And keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is stern in reprisal. ^qPickthall597


Whatsoever spoils of war God has given to His Messenger from the people of the cities belongs to God, and His Messenger, and the near kinsman, orphans, the needy and the traveller, so that it be not a thing taken in turns among the rich of you. Whatever the Messenger gives you, take; whatever he forbids you, give over. And fear God; surely God is terrible in retribution. ^qArberry597

Lilfuqaraaa'il Muhaaji reenal lazeena ukhrijoo min diyaarihim wa amwaalihim yabtaghoona fadlam minal laahi wa ridwaananw wa yansuroonal laaha wa Rasoolah; ulaaa'ika humus saadiqoon ^qTrans598


[Thus, part of such war-gains shall be given] to the poor among those who have forsaken the domain of evil: those who have been driven from their homelands and their possessions, seeking favour with God and [His] goodly acceptance, and who aid [the cause of] God and His Apostle: it is they, they who are true to their word! ^qAsad598


And (it is) for the poor fugitives who have been driven out from their homes and their belongings, who seek bounty from Allah and help Allah and His messenger. They are the loyal. ^qPickthall598


It is for the poor emigrants, who were expelled from their habitations and their possessions, seeking bounty from God and good pleasure, and helping God and His Messenger; those -- they are the truthful ones. ^qArberry598

Wallazeena tabawwa'ud daara wal eemaana min qablihim yuhibboona man haajara ilaihim wa laa yajidoona fee sudoorihim haajatam mimmaa ootoo wa yu'siroona 'alaa anfusihim wa law kaana bihim khasaasah; wa many yooqa shuhha nafsihee fa ulaaa'ika humul muflihoon ^qTrans599


And [it shall be offered, too, unto the poor from among] those who, before them, had their abode in this realm and in faith - [those] who love all that come to them in search of refuge, and who harbour in their hearts no grudge for whatever the others may have been given, but rather give them preference over themselves, even though poverty be their own lot: for, such as from their own covetousness are saved - it is they, they that shall attain to a happy state! ^qAsad599


Those who entered the city and the faith before them love those who flee unto them for refuge, and find in their breasts no need for that which hath been given them, but prefer (the fugitives) above themselves though poverty become their lot. And whoso is saved from his own avarice - such are they who are successful. ^qPickthall599


And those who made their dwelling in the abode, and in belief, before them; love whosoever has emigrated to them, not finding in their breasts any need for what they have been given, and preferring others above themselves, even though poverty be their portion. And whoso is guarded against the avarice of his own soul, those -- they are the prosperers. ^qArberry599

And so, they who come after them pray: “O our Sustainer! Forgive us our sins, as well as those of our brethren who preceded us in faith, and let not our hearts entertain any unworthy thoughts or feelings against [any of] those who have attained to faith. O our Sustainer! Verily, Thou art compassionate, a dispenser of grace!” ^qAsad5910


And those who came (into the faith) after them say: Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who were before us in the faith, and place not in our hearts any rancour toward those who believe. Our Lord! Thou art Full of Pity, Merciful. ^qPickthall5910


And as for those who came after them, they say, 'Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers, who preceded us in belief, and put Thou not into our hearts any rancour towards those who believe. Our Lord, surely Thou art the All-gentle, the All-compassionate.' ^qArberry5910

Alam tara ilal lazeena naafaqoo yaqooloona li ikhwaanihimul lazeena kafaroo min ahlil kitaabi la'in ukhrijtum lanakhrujanna ma'akum wa laa nutee'u feekum ahadan abadanw-wa in qootiltum lanansuran nakum wallaahu yashhadu innahum lakaaziboon ^qTrans5911


ART THOU NOT aware of how those who would always dissemble [their real feelings] speak to their truth-denying brethren from among the followers of earlier revelation: “If you are driven away, we shall most certainly go forth with you, and shall never pay heed to anyone against you; and if war is waged against you, we shall most certainly come to your succour.” But God bears witness that they are most flagrantly lying: ^qAsad5911


Hast thou not observed those who are hypocrites, (how) they tell their brethren who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture: If ye are driven out, we surely will go out with you, and we will never obey anyone against you, and if ye are attacked we verily will help you. And Allah beareth witness that they verily are liars. ^qPickthall5911


Hast thou not regarded the hypocrites, saying to their brothers of the People of the Book who disbelieve, 'If you are expelled, we will go forth with you, and we will never obey anyone in regard to you. If you are fought against, we will help you.' And God bears witness that they are truly liars. ^qArberry5911

La'in ukhrijoo laa yakhrujoona ma'ahum wa la'in qootiloo laa yansuroonahum wa la'in nasaroohum la yuwallunnal adbaara summa laa yunsaroon ^qTrans5912


[for] if those [to whom they have pledged themselves] are indeed driven away, they will not go forth with them; and if war is waged against them, they will not come to their succour; and even if they [try to] succour them, they will most certainly turn their backs [in flight], and in the end will [themselves] find no succour. ^qAsad5912


(For) indeed if they are driven out they go not out with them, and indeed if they are attacked they help them not, and indeed if they had helped them they would have turned and fled, and then they would not have been victorious. ^qPickthall5912


If those are expelled, they will not go forth with them, and if they are fought against, they will not help them. Even if they helped them, they would surely turn their backs, then they would not be helped. ^qArberry5912

# 13

La antum ashaddu rahbatan fee sudoorihim minal laah; zaalika bi annahum qawmul laa yafqahoon ^qTrans5913


Nay, [O believers,] you arouse in their bosoms a fear more intense than [even their fear of] God: this, because they are people who fail to grasp the truth. ^qAsad5913


Ye are more awful as a fear in their bosoms than Allah. That is because they are a folk who understand not. ^qPickthall5913


Why, you arouse greater fear in their hearts than God; that is because they are a people who understand not. ^qArberry5913

# 14

Laa yuqaatiloonakum jamee'an illaa fee quram muhas sanatin aw minw waraaa'i judur; baasuhum bainahum shadeed; tahsabuhum jamee'anw-wa quloobuhum shatta; zaalika biannahum qawmul laa ya'qiloon ^qTrans5914


Never will they fight you, [even] in unison, otherwise than from within fortified strongholds or from behind walls. Severe is their warlike discord among themselves: thou wouldst think that they are united, whereas [in fact] their hearts are at odds [with one another]: this, because they are people who will not use their reason. ^qAsad5914


They will not fight against you in a body save in fortified villages or from behind walls. Their adversity among themselves is very great. Ye think of them as a whole whereas their hearts are divers. That is because they are a folk who have no sense. ^qPickthall5914


They will not fight against you all together except in fortified cities, or from behind walls. Their valour is great, among themselves; you think of them as a host; but their hearts are scattered; that is because they are a people who have no sense. ^qArberry5914

# 15

Kamasalil lazeena min qablihim qareeban zaaqoo wabaala amrihim wa lahum 'azaabun aleem ^qTrans5915


[To both kinds of your enemies, O believers, is bound to happen] the like of [what happened to] those who, a short while before them, had to taste the evil that came from their own doings, with [yet more] grievous suffering awaiting them [in the life to come]: ^qAsad5915


On the likeness of those (who suffered) a short time before them, they taste the ill-effects of their own conduct, and theirs is painful punishment. ^qPickthall5915


Like those who a short time before them tasted the mischief of their action; there awaits them a painful chastisement. ^qArberry5915

# 16

Kamasalish shaitaani izqaala lil insaanik fur falammaa kafara qaala innee bareee'um minka inneee akhaaful laaha rabbal 'aalameen ^qTrans5916


the like of [what happens] when Satan says unto man, “Deny the truth!” - but as soon as [man] has denied the truth, [Satan] says, “Behold, I am not responsible for thee: behold, I fear God, the Sustainer of all the worlds!” ^qAsad5916


(And the hypocrites are) on the likeness of the devil when he telleth man to disbelieve, then, when he disbelieveth saith: Lo! I am quit of thee. Lo! I fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. ^qPickthall5916


Like Satan, when he said to man, 'Disbelieve'; then, when he disbelieved, he said, 'Surely I am quit of you. Surely I fear God, the Lord of all Being.' ^qArberry5916

# 17

Fakaana 'aaqibatahumaaa annahumaa fin naari khaalidaini feehaa; wa zaalika jazaaa'uz zaalimeen ^qTrans5917


Thus, in the end, both [the deniers of the truth and the hypocrites] will find themselves in the fire, therein to abide: for such is the recompense of evil­doers. ^qAsad5917


And the consequence for both will be that they are in the Fire, therein abiding. Such is the reward of evil-doers. ^qPickthall5917


Their end is, both are in the Fire, there dwelling forever; that is the recompense of the evildoers. ^qArberry5917

Yaaa ayyuhal lazeena aamanut taqul laa; waltanzur nafsum maa qaddamat lighadiw wattaqual laah; innal laaha khabeerum bimaa ta'maloon ^qTrans5918


O YOU who have attained to faith! Remain conscious of God; and let every human being look to what he sends ahead for the morrow! And [once again]: Remain conscious of God, for God is fully aware of all that you do; ^qAsad5918


O ye who believe! Observe your duty to Allah. And let every soul look to that which it sendeth on before for the morrow. And observe your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is Informed of what ye do. ^qPickthall5918


O believers, fear God. Let every soul consider what it has forwarded for the morrow. And fear God; God is aware of the things you do. ^qArberry5918

# 19

Wa laa takoonoo kallazeena nasul laaha fa ansaahum anfusahum; ulaaa'ika humul faasiqoon ^qTrans5919


and be not like those who are oblivious of God, and whom He therefore causes to be oblivious of [what is good for] their own selves: [for] it is they, they who are truly depraved! ^qAsad5919


And be not ye as those who forgot Allah, therefor He caused them to forget their souls. Such are the evil-doers. ^qPickthall5919


Be not as those who forgot God, and so He caused them to forget their souls; those -- they are the ungodly. ^qArberry5919

# 20

Laa yastaweee as-haabun naari wa ashaabul jannah; as haabul jannati humul faaa'izoon ^qTrans5920


Not equal are those who are destined for the fire and those who are destined for paradise: those who are destined for paradise - it is they, they [alone] who shall triumph [on Judgment Day]! ^qAsad5920


Not equal are the owners of the Fire and the owners of the Garden. The owners of the Garden, they are the victorious. ^qPickthall5920


Not equal are the inhabitants of the Fire and the inhabitants of Paradise. The inhabitants of Paradise -- they are the triumphant. ^qArberry5920

HAD WE bestowed this Qur’an from on high upon a mountain, thou wouldst indeed see it humbling itself, breaking asunder for awe of God. And [all] such parables We propound unto men, so that they might [learn to] think. ^qAsad5921


If We had caused this Qur'an to descend upon a mountain, thou (O Muhammad) verily hadst seen it humbled, rent asunder by the fear of Allah. Such similitudes coin We for mankind that haply they may reflect. ^qPickthall5921


If We had sent down this Koran upon a mountain, thou wouldst have seen it humbled, split asunder out of the fear of God. And those similitudes -- We strike them for men; haply they will reflect. ^qArberry5921

Huwal-laahul-lazee laaa Ilaaha illaa Huwa 'Aalimul Ghaibi wash-shahaada; Huwar Rahmaanur-Raheem ^qTrans5922


GOD IS HE save whom there is no deity: the One who knows all that is beyond the reach of a created being’s perception, as well as all that can be wit­nessed by a creature’s senses or mind: He, the Most Gracious, the Dispenser of Grace. ^qAsad5922


He is Allah, than Whom there is no other Allah, the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible. He is the Beneficent, Merciful. ^qPickthall5922


He is God; there is no god but He. He is the knower of the Unseen and the Visible; He is the All-merciful, the All-compassionate. ^qArberry5922

God is He save whom there is no deity: the Sovereign Supreme, the Holy, the One with whom all salvation rests, the Giver of Faith, the One who determines what is true and false, the Almighty, the One who subdues wrong and restores right, the One to whom all greatness belongs! Utterly remote is God, in His limitless glory, from anything to which men may ascribe a share in His divinity! ^qAsad5923


He is Allah, than Whom there is no other Allah, the Sovereign Lord, the Holy One, Peace, the Keeper of Faith, the Guardian, the Majestic, the Compeller, the Superb. Glorified be Allah from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him). ^qPickthall5923


He is God; there is no god but He. He is the King, the All-holy, the All-peaceable, the All-faithful, the All-preserver, the All-mighty, the All-compeller, the All-sublime. Glory be to God, above that they associate! ^qArberry5923

He is Allah, the Creator, the Shaper out of naught, the Fashioner. His are the most beautiful names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifieth Him, and He is the Mighty, the Wise. ^qPickthall5924


He is God, the Creator, the Maker, the Shaper. To Him belong the Names Most Beautiful. All that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies Him; He is the All-mighty, the All-wise. ^qArberry5924
