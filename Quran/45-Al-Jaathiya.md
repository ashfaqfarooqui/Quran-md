And We gave them clear indications of the purpose [of faith]; and it was only after all this knowledge had been vouchsafed to them that they began, out of mutual jealousy, to hold divergent views: [but,] verily, thy Sustainer will judge be­tween them on Resurrection Day regarding all whereon they were wont to differ. ^qAsad4517


And gave them plain commandments. And they differed not until after the knowledge came unto them, through rivalry among themselves. Lo! thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ. ^qPickthall4517


We gave them clear signs of the Command; so they differed not, except after the knowledge had come to them, being insolent one to another. Surely thy Lord will decide between them on the Day of Resurrection touching their differences. ^qArberry4517

And, finally, [O Muhammad,] We have set thee on a way by which the purpose [of faith] may be fulfilled: so follow thou this [way], and follow not the likes and dislikes of those who do not know [the truth]. ^qAsad4518


And now have We set thee (O Muhammad) on a clear road of (Our) commandment; so follow it, and follow not the whims of those who know not. ^qPickthall4518


Then We set thee upon an open way of the Command; therefore follow it, and follow not the caprices of those who do not know. ^qArberry4518

Innahum lany yughnoo 'anka minal laahi shai'aa; wa innaz zaalimeena ba'duhum awliyaaa'u ba'dinw wallaahu waliyyul muttaqeen ^qTrans4519


Behold, they could never be of any avail to thee if thou wert to defy the will of God for, verily, such evildoers are but friends and protectors of one another, whereas God is the Protector of all who are conscious of Him. ^qAsad4519


Lo! they can avail thee naught against Allah. And lo! as for the wrong-doers, some of them are friends of others; and Allah is the Friend of those who ward off (evil). ^qPickthall4519


Surely they will not avail thee aught against God. Surely the evildoers are friends one of the other; God is the friend of the godfearing. ^qArberry4519

Now as for those who indulge in sinful doings - do they think that We place them, both in their life and their death, on an equal footing with those who have attained to faith and do righteous deeds? Bad, indeed, is their judgment: ^qAsad4521


Or do those who commit ill-deeds suppose that We shall make them as those who believe and do good works, the same in life and death? Bad is their judgment! ^qPickthall4521


Or do those who commit evil deeds think that We shall make them as those who believe and do righteous deeds, equal their living and their dying? How ill they judge! ^qArberry4521

# 22

Wa khalaqal laahus samaawaati wal arda bilhaqqi wa litujzaa kullu nafsim bimaa kasabat wa hum laa yuzlamoon ^qTrans4522


for, God has created the heavens and the earth in accordance with [an inner] truth, and [has therefore willed] that every human being shall be recompensed for what he has earned and none shall be wronged. ^qAsad4522

HAST THOU ever considered [the kind of man] who makes his own desires his deity, and whom God has [thereupon] let go astray, knowing [that his mind is closed to all guidance], and whose hearing and heart He has sealed, and upon whose sight He has placed a veil? Who, then, could guide him after God [has abandoned him]? Will you not, then, bethink your­selves? ^qAsad4523


Hast thou seen him who maketh his desire his god, and Allah sendeth him astray purposely, and sealeth up his hearing and his heart, and setteth on his sight a covering? Then who will lead him after Allah (hath condemned him)? Will ye not then heed? ^qPickthall4523


Hast thou seen him who has taken his caprice to be his god, and God has led him astray out of a knowledge, and set a seal upon his hearing and his heart, and laid a covering on his eyes? Who shall guide him after God? What, will you not remember? ^qArberry4523

# 24

Wa qaaloo maa hiya illaa hayaatunad dunyaa namootu wa nahyaa wa maa yuhlikunaaa illad dahr; wa maa lahum bizaalika min 'ilmin in hum illaayazunnoon ^qTrans4524


And yet they say: “There is nothing beyond our life in this world. We die as we come to life, and nothing but time destroys us.” But of this they have no knowledge whatever: they do nothing but guess. ^qAsad4524


And they say: There is naught but our life of the world; we die and we live, and naught destroyeth us save time; when they have no knowledge whatsoever of (all) that; they do but guess. ^qPickthall4524


They say, 'There is nothing but our present life; we die, and we live, and nothing but Time destroys us.' Of that they have no knowledge; they merely conjecture. ^qArberry4524

# 25

Wa izaa tutlaa 'alaihim aayaatuna baiyinaatim maa kaana hujjatahum illaaa an qaalu'too bi aabaaa'inaaa in kuntum saadiqeen ^qTrans4525


And [so,] whenever Our messages are conveyed to them in all their clarity, their only argument is this: “Bring forth our fore­fathers [as witnesses], if what you claim is true!” ^qAsad4525


And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them their only argument is that they say: Bring (back) our fathers. then, if ye are truthful. ^qPickthall4525


And when Our signs are recited to them, clear signs, their only argument is that they say, 'Bring us our fathers, if you speak truly.' ^qArberry4525

Qulil laahu yuhyeekum summa yumeetukum summa yajma'ukum ilaa Yawmil Qiyaamati laa raiba feehi wa laakinna aksaran naasi laa ya'lamoon ^qTrans4526


Say: “It is God who gives you life, and then causes you to die; and in the end He will gather you together on Resurrection Day, [the coming of] which is beyond all doubt - but most human beings under­stand it not.” ^qAsad4526


Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Allah giveth life to you, then causeth you to die, then gathereth you unto the Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt. But most of mankind know not. ^qPickthall4526


Say: 'God gives you life, then makes you die, then He shall gather you to the Day of Resurrection, wherein is no doubt, but most men do not know.' ^qArberry4526

# 27

Wa lillaahi mulkus samaawaati wal ard; wa Yawma taqoomus Saa'atu Yawma 'iziny yakhsarul mubtiloon ^qTrans4527


For, God’s is the dominion over the heavens and the earth; and on the Day when the Last Hour dawns - on that Day will be lost all who [in their lifetime] tried to reduce to nothing [whatever they could not understand]. ^qAsad4527


And unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth; and on the day when the Hour riseth, on that day those who follow falsehood will be lost. ^qPickthall4527


To God belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And on the day when the Hour is come, upon that day the vain-doers shall lose. ^qArberry4527

Wa taraa kulla ummatin jaasiyah; kullu ummatin tud'aaa ilaa kitaabihaa al Yawma tujzawna maa kuntum ta'maloon ^qTrans4528


And [on that Day] thou wilt see all people kneeling down [in humility]: all people will be called upon to [face] their record: “Today you shall be requited for all that you ever did! ^qAsad4528


And thou wilt see each nation crouching, each nation summoned to its record. (And it will be said unto them): This day ye are requited what ye used to do. ^qPickthall4528


And thou shalt see every nation hobbling on their knees, every nation being summoned unto its Book: 'Today you shall be recompensed for that you were doing. ^qArberry4528

# 29

Haazaa kitaabunaa yantiqu 'alaikum bilhaqq; innaa kunnaa nastansikhu maa kuntum ta'maloon ^qTrans4529


This Our record speaks of you in all truth: for, verily, We have caused to be recorded all that you ever did!” ^qAsad4529


This Our Book pronounceth against you with truth. Lo! We have caused (all) that ye did to be recorded. ^qPickthall4529


This is Our Book, that speaks against you the truth; We have been registering all that you were doing.' ^qArberry4529

# 30

Fa ammal lazeena aamaanoo wa 'amilus saalihaati fayudkhiluhum Rabbuhum fee rahmatih; zaalika huwal fawzul mubeen ^qTrans4530


Now as for those who have attained to faith and done righteous deeds, their Sustainer will admit them to His grace: that will be [their] manifest triumph! ^qAsad4530


Then, as for those who believed and did good works, their Lord will bring them in unto His mercy. That is the evident triumph. ^qPickthall4530


And as for those who have believed and done deeds of righteousness, their Lord shall admit them into His mercy; that is the manifest triumph. ^qArberry4530

# 31

Wa ammal lazeena kafarooo afalam takun Aayaatee tutlaa 'alaikum fastakbartum wa kuntum qawmam mujrimeen ^qTrans4531


But as for those who were bent on denying the truth, [they will be told:] “Were not My messages conveyed to you? And withal, you gloried in your arrogance, and so you became people lost in sin: ^qAsad4531


And as for those who disbelieved (it will be said unto them): Were not Our revelations recited unto you? But ye were scornful and became a guilty folk. ^qPickthall4531


But as for those who have disbelieved: 'Were not My signs recited to you, and you waxed proud, and were a sinful people? ^qArberry4531

Wa izaa qeela inna wa'dallaahi haqqunw was Saa'atu laa raiba feehaa qultum maa nadree mas Saa'atu in nazunnu illaa zannanw wa maa nahnu bimustaiqineen ^qTrans4532


for when it was said, ‘Behold, God’s promise always comes true, and there can be no doubt about [the coming of] the Last Hour’ - you would answer, ‘We do not know what that Last Hour may be: we think it is no more than an empty guess, and [so] we are by no means convinced!’” ^qAsad4532


And when it was said: Lo! Allah's promise is the truth, and there is no doubt of the Hour's coming, ye said: We know not what the Hour is. We deem it naught but a conjecture, and we are by no means convinced. ^qPickthall4532


And when it was said, "God's promise is true, and the Hour, there is no doubt of it," you said; "We know not what the Hour may be; we have only a surmise, and are by no means certain." ^qArberry4532

# 33

Wa badaa lahum saiyiaatu maa 'amiloo wa haaqa bihim maa kaanoo bihee yastahzi'oon ^qTrans4533


And [on that Day,] the evil of their doings will become obvious to them, and they will be over­whelmed by the very thing which they were wont to deride. ^qAsad4533


And the evils of what they did will appear unto them, and that which they used to deride will befall them. ^qPickthall4533


And the evil deeds that they have done shall appear to them, and they shall be encompassed by that they mocked at. ^qArberry4533

# 34

Wa qeelal yawma nansaakum kamaa naseetum liqaaa'a yawmikum haazaa wa maawaakumun Naaru wa maa lakum min naasireen ^qTrans4534


And [the word] will be spoken: “Today We shall be oblivious of you as you were oblivious of the coming of this your Day [of Judgment]; and so your goal is the fire, and you shall have none to succour you: ^qAsad4534


And it will be said: This day We forget you, even as ye forgot the meeting of this your day; and your habitation is the Fire, and there is none to help you. ^qPickthall4534


And it shall be said, 'Today We do forget you, even as you forgot the encounter of this your day; and your refuge is the Fire, and you shall have no helpers. ^qArberry4534

# 35

Zaalikum bi annakumut takhaztum aayaatil laahi huzuwanw wa gharratkumul hayaatud dunyaa; fal yawma laa yukhrajoona minhaa wa laahum yusta'taboon ^qTrans4535


this, because you made God’s messages the target of your mockery, having allowed the life of this world to beguile you!” On that Day, therefore, they will not be brought out of the fire, nor will they be allowed to make amends. ^qAsad4535


This, forasmuch as ye made the revelations of Allah a jest, and the life of the world beguiled you. Therefor this day they come not forth from thence, nor can they make amends. ^qPickthall4535


That is for that you took God's signs in mockery, and the present life deluded you.' So today they shall not be brought forth from it, nor will they be suffered to make amends. ^qArberry4535

# 36

Falillaahil hamdu Rabbis samaawaati wa Rabbil ardi Rabbil-'aalameen ^qTrans4536


AND THUS, all praise is due to God, Sustainer of the heavens and Sustainer of the earth: the Sustainer of all the worlds! ^qAsad4536


Then praise be to Allah, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth, the Lord of the Worlds. ^qPickthall4536


So to God belongs praise, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, Lord of all Being. ^qArberry4536

Wa lahul kibriyaaa'u fissamaawaati wal ardi wa Huwal 'Azeezul Hakeem ^qTrans4537


And His alone is all majesty in the heavens and on earth; and He alone is almighty, truly wise! ^qAsad4537


And unto Him (alone) belongeth Majesty in the heavens and the earth, and He is the Mighty, the Wise. ^qPickthall4537


His is the Domination an the heavens and the earth; He is the All-mighty, the All-wise. ^qArberry4537
