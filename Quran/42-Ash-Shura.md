Kazaalika yooheee ilaika wa ilal lazeena min qablikal laahul 'Azeezul Hakeem ^qTrans423


THUS has God, the Almighty, the Wise, revealed [the truth] unto thee, [O Muhammad,] and unto those who preceded thee: ^qAsad423


Thus Allah the Mighty, the Knower inspireth thee (Muhammad) as (He inspired) those before thee. ^qPickthall423


So reveals to thee, and to those before thee, God, the All-mighty, the All-wise. ^qArberry423

Lahoo maa fis samaa waati wa maa fil ardi wa Huwal 'Aliyul 'Azeem ^qTrans424


His is all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth; and most exalted, tremendous is He. ^qAsad424


Unto Him belongeth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and He is the Sublime, the Tremendous. ^qPickthall424


To Him belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth; and He is the All-high, the All-glorious. ^qArberry424

Takaadus samaawaatu yatafattarna min fawqihinn; walmalaaa'ikatu yusabbihoona bihamdi Rabbihim wa yastaghfiroona liman fil ard; alaaa innal laaha huwal Ghafoorur Raheem ^qTrans425


The uppermost heavens are well-nigh rent asunder [for awe of Him]; and the angels extol their Sustainer’s limitless glory and praise, and ask for­giveness for all who are on earth. Oh, verily, God alone is truly-forgiving, a dispenser of grace! ^qAsad425


Almost might the heavens above be rent asunder while the angels hymn the praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on the earth. Lo! Allah, He is the Forgiver, the Merciful. ^qPickthall425


The heavens wellnigh are rent above them, when the angels proclaim the praise of their Lord, and ask forgiveness for those on earth. Surely God -- He is the All-forgiving, the All-compassionate. ^qArberry425

Wallazeenat takhazoo min dooniheee awliyaaa'al laahu hafeezun 'alaihim wa maaa anta 'alaihim biwakeel ^qTrans426


NOW AS FOR those who take aught beside Him for their protectors - God watches them, and thou art not responsible for their conduct. ^qAsad426


And as for those who choose protecting friends beside Him, Allah is Warden over them, and thou art in no wise a guardian over them. ^qPickthall426


And those who have taken to them protectors apart from Him -- God is Warden over them; thou art not a guardian over them. ^qArberry426

Wa kazaalika awhainaaa llaika Qur-aanan 'Arabiyyal litunzir aUmmal Quraa wa man hawlahaa wa tunzira Yawmal Jam'ilaa raiba feeh; fareequn fil jannati wa fareequn fissa'eer ^qTrans427


[Thou art but entrusted with Our message:] and so We have revealed unto thee a discourse in the Arabic tongue in order that thou mayest warn the foremost of all cities and all who dwell around it to wit, warn [them] of the Day of the Gathering, [the coming of] which is beyond all doubt: [the Day when] some shall find themselves in paradise, and some in the blazing flame. ^qAsad427


And thus We have inspired in thee a Lecture in Arabic, that thou mayst warn the mother-town and those around it, and mayst warn of a day of assembling whereof there is no doubt. A host will be in the Garden, and a host of them in the Flame. ^qPickthall427


And so We have revealed to thee an Arabic Koran, that thou mayest warn the Mother of Cities and those who dwell about it, and that thou mayest warn of the Day of Gathering, wherein is no doubt -- a party in Paradise, and a party in the Blaze. ^qArberry427

Wa law shaaa'al laahu laja'alahum ummatanw waahi datanw walaakiny yudkhilumany yashaaa'u fee rahmatih; waz zaalimoona maa lahum minw waliyyinw wa laa naseer ^qTrans428


Now had God so willed, He could surely have made them all one single community: none the less, He admits unto His grace him that wills [to be admitted] whereas the evildoers shall have none to protect them and none to succour them [on Judgment Day]. ^qAsad428


Had Allah willed, He could have made them one community, but Allah bringeth whom He will into His mercy. And the wrong-doers have no friend nor helper. ^qPickthall428


If God had willed, He would have made them one nation; but He admits whomsoever He will into His mercy, and the evildoers shall have neither protector nor helper. ^qArberry428

Amit takhazoo min dooniheee awliyaaa'a fallaahu Huwal Waliyyu wa Huwa yuhyil mawtaa wa Huwa 'alaa kulli shai'in Qadeer ^qTrans429


Did they, perchance, [think that they could] choose protectors other than Him? But God alone is the Protector [of all that exists], since it is He alone who brings the dead to life, and He alone who has the power to will anything. ^qAsad429


Or have they chosen protecting friends besides Him? But Allah, He (alone) is the Protecting Friend. He quickeneth the dead, and He is Able to do all things. ^qPickthall429


Or have they taken to them protectors apart from Him? But God -- He is the Protector; He quickens the dead, and He is powerful over everything. ^qArberry429

Wa makh-talaftum feehi min shai'in fahukmuhooo ilallaah; zaalikumul laahu Rabbee 'alaihi tawakkaltu wa ilaihi uneeb ^qTrans4210


AND ON WHATEVER you may differ, [O believers,] the verdict thereon rests with God. [Say, therefore:] “Such is God, my Sustainer: in Him have I placed my trust, and unto Him do I always turn!” ^qAsad4210


And in whatsoever ye differ, the verdict therein belongeth to Allah. Such is my Lord, in Whom I put my trust, and unto Whom I turn. ^qPickthall4210


And whatever you are at variance on, the judgment thereof belongs to God. That then is God, my Lord; in Him I have put my trust, and to Him I turn, penitent. ^qArberry4210

The Originator [is He] of the heavens and the earth. He has given you mates of your own kind just as [He has willed that] among the beasts [there be] mates - to multiply you thereby: [but] there is nothing like unto Him, and He alone is all-hearing, all-seeing. ^qAsad4211


The Creator of the heavens and the earth. He hath made for you pairs of yourselves, and of the cattle also pairs, whereby He multiplieth you. Naught is as His likeness; and He is the Hearer, the Seer. ^qPickthall4211


The Originator of the heavens and the earth; He has appointed for you, of yourselves, pairs, and pairs also of the cattle, therein multiplying you. Like Him there is naught; He is the All-hearing, the All-seeing. ^qArberry4211

Lahoo maqaaleedus samaawaati wal ardi yabsutur rizqa limany yashaaa'u wa yaqdir; innahoo bikulli shai'unw wa Huwas Samee'ul Baseer ^qTrans4212


His are the keys of the heavens and the earth: He grants abundant sustenance, or gives it in scant measure, unto whomever He wills: for, behold, He has full knowledge of everything. ^qAsad4212


His are the keys of the heavens and the earth. He enlargeth providence for whom He will and straiteneth (it for whom He will). Lo! He is Knower of all things. ^qPickthall4212


To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. He outspreads and straitens His provision to whom He will; surely He has knowledge of everything. ^qArberry4212

Shara'a lakum minad deeni maa wassaa bihee Noohanw wallazeee awhainaaa ilaika wa maa wassainaa biheee Ibraaheema wa Moosa wa 'Eesaaa an aqeemud adeena wa laa tatafarraqoo feeh; kabura 'alal mushrikeena maa tad'oohum ilaih; Allaahu yajtabee ilaihi many yashaaa'u wa yahdeee ilaihi mai yuneeb ^qTrans4213


In matters of faith, He has ordained for you that which He had enjoined upon Noah - and into which We gave thee [O Muhammad] insight through revelation as well as that which We had enjoined upon Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus: Steadfastly uphold the [true] faith, and do not break up your unity therein. [And even though] that [unity of faith] to which thou callest them appears oppressive to those who are wont to ascribe to other beings or forces a share in His divinity, God draws unto Himself everyone who is willing, and guides unto Himself everyone who turns unto Him. ^qAsad4213


He hath ordained for you that religion which He commended unto Noah, and that which We inspire in thee (Muhammad), and that which We commended unto Abraham and Moses and Jesus, saying: Establish the religion, and be not divided therein. Dreadful for the idolaters is that unto which thou callest them. Allah chooseth for Himself whom He will, and guideth unto Himself him who turneth (toward Him). ^qPickthall4213


He has laid down for you as religion that He charged Noah with, and that We have revealed to thee, and that We charged Abraham with, Moses and Jesus: 'Perform the religion, and scatter not regarding it. Very hateful is that for the idolaters, that thou callest them to. God chooses unto Himself whomsoever He will, and He guides to Himself whosoever turns, penitent. ^qArberry4213

Wa maa tafarraqooo illaa mim ba'di maa jaaa'ahumul 'ilmu baghyam bainahum; wa law laa Kalimatun sabaqat mir Rabbika ilaaa ajalim musammal laqudiya bainahum; wa innal lazeena oorisul Kitaaba mim ba'dihim lafee shakkim minhu mureeb ^qTrans4214


And [as for the followers of earlier revelation,] they broke up their unity, out of mutual jealousy, only after they had come to know [the truth]. And had it not been for a decree that had already gone forth from thy Sustainer, [postponing all decision] until a term set [by Him], all would indeed have been decided between them [from the outset]. As it is, behold, they who have inherited their divine writ from those who preceded them are [now] in grave doubt, amounting to suspicion, about what it por­tends. ^qAsad4214


And they were not divided until after the knowledge came unto them, through rivalry among themselves; and had it not been for a Word that had already gone forth from thy Lord for an appointed term, it surely had been judged between them. And those who were made to inherit the Scripture after them are verily in hopeless doubt concerning it. ^qPickthall4214


They scattered not, save after knowledge had come to them, being insolent one to another; and but for a Word that preceded from thy Lord until a stated term, it had been decided between them. But those to whom the Book has been given as an inheritance after them, behold, they are in doubt of it disquieting. ^qArberry4214

# 15

Falizaalika fad'u wastaqim kamaaa umirta wa laa tattabi' ahwaaa'ahum wa qul aamantu bimaaa anzalal laahu min Kitaab, wa umirtu li a'dila bainakum Allaahu Rabbunaa wa Rabbukum lanaaa a'maa lunaa wa lakum a'maalukim laa hujjata bainanaa wa baina kumul laahu yajma'u bainanaa wa ilaihil maseer ^qTrans4215


Because of this, then, summon [all mankind], and pursue the right course, as thou hast been bidden [by God]; and do not follow their likes and dislikes, but say: “I believe in whatever revelation God has be­stowed from on high; and I am bidden to bring about equity in your mutual views. God is our Sustainer as well as your Sustainer. To us shall be accounted our deeds, and to you, your deeds. Let there be no contention between us and you: God will bring us all together - for with Him is all journeys’ end.” ^qAsad4215


Unto this, then, summon (O Muhammad). And be thou upright as thou art commanded, and follow not their lusts, but say: I believe in whatever scripture Allah hath sent down, and I am commanded to be just among you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord. Unto us our works and unto you your works; no argument between us and you. Allah will bring us together, and unto Him is the journeying. ^qPickthall4215


Therefore call thou, and go straight as thou hast been commanded; do not follow their caprices. And say: 'I believe in whatever Book God has sent down; I have been commanded to be just between you. God is our Lord and your Lord. We have our deeds, and you have your deeds; there is no argument between us and you; God shall bring us together, and unto Him is the homecoming.' ^qArberry4215

Wallazeena yuhaaajjoona fil laahi mim ba'di mastujeeba lahoo hujjatuhum daahidatun 'inda Rabbihim wa 'alaihim ghadabunw wa lahum 'azaabun shadeed ^qTrans4216


And as for those who would [still] argue about God after He has been acknowledged [by them] all their arguments are null and void in their Sustainer’s sight, and upon them will fall [His] condemnation, and for them is suffering severe in store: ^qAsad4216


And those who argue concerning Allah after He hath been acknowledged, their argument hath no weight with their Lord, and wrath is upon them and theirs will be an awful doom. ^qPickthall4216


And those who argue concerning God after that answer has been made to Him, their argument is null and void in the sight of their Lord; anger shall rest upon them, and there awaits them a terrible chastisement. ^qArberry4216

# 17

Allahul lazeee anzalal Kitaaba bilhaqqi wal Meezaan; wa ma yudreeka la'allas Saa'ata qareeb ^qTrans4217


[for] it is God [Himself] who has bestowed revelation from on high, setting forth the truth, and [thus given man] a balance [wherewith to weigh right and wrong]. And for all thou knowest, the Last Hour may well be near! ^qAsad4217


Allah it is Who hath revealed the Scripture with truth, and the Balance. How canst thou know? It may be that the Hour is nigh. ^qPickthall4217


God it is who has sent down the Book with the truth, and also the Balance. And what shall make thee know? Haply the Hour is nigh. ^qArberry4217

# 18

Yasta'jilu bihal lazeena laa yu'minoona bihaa wallazeena aamanoo mushfiqoona minhaa wa ya'lamoona annahal haqq; alaaa innal lazeena yumaaroona fis Saa'ati lafee dalaalim ba'eed ^qTrans4218


Those who do not believe in it [mockingly] ask for its speedy advent whereas those who have attained to faith stand in awe of it, and know it to be the truth. Oh, verily, they who call the Last Hour in question have indeed gone far astray! ^qAsad4218


Those who believe not therein seek to hasten it, while those who believe are fearful of it and know that it is the Truth. Are not they who dispute, in doubt concerning the Hour, far astray? ^qPickthall4218


Those that believe not therein seek to hasten it; but those who believe in it go in fear of it, knowing that it is the truth. Why, surely those who are in doubt concerning the Hour are indeed in far error. ^qArberry4218

# 19

Allahu lateefum bi'ibaadihee yarzuqu mai yashaaa'u wa Huwal Qawiyyul 'Azeez ^qTrans4219


GOD is most kind unto His creatures: He provides sustenance for whomever He wills - for He alone is powerful, almighty! ^qAsad4219


Allah is gracious unto His slaves. He provideth for whom He will. And He is the Strong, the Mighty. ^qPickthall4219


God is All-gentle to His servants, providing for whomsoever He will. He is the All-strong, the All-mighty. ^qArberry4219

# 20

Man kaana yureedu harsal Aakhirati nazid lahoo fee harsihee wa man kaana yureedu harsad dunyaa nu'tihee mnhaa wa maa lahoo fil Aakhirati min naseeb ^qTrans4220


To him who desires a harvest in the life to come, We shall grant an increase in his harvest; whereas to him who desires [but] a harvest in this world, We [may] give something thereof - but he will have no share in [the blessings of] the life to come. ^qAsad4220


Whoso desireth the harvest of the Hereafter, We give him increase in its harvest. And whoso desireth the harvest of the world, We give him thereof, and he hath no portion in the Hereafter. ^qPickthall4220


Whoso desires the tillage of the world to come, We shall give him increase in his tillage; and whoso desires the tillage of this world, We shall give him of it, but in the world to come he will have no share. ^qArberry4220

# 21

Am lahum shurakaaa'u shara'oo lahum minad deeni maa lam yaazam bihil laah; wa law laa kalimatul fasli laqudiya bainahum; wa innaz zaalimeena lahum 'azaabun aleem ^qTrans4221


Is it that they [who care for no more than this world] believe in forces supposed to have a share in God’s divinity, which enjoin upon them as a moral law something that God has never allowed? Now were it not for [God’s] decree on the final judgment, all would indeed have been decided be­tween them [in this world]: but, verily, grievous suffering awaits the evildoers [in the life to come]. ^qAsad4221


Or have they partners (of Allah) who have made lawful for them in religion that which Allah allowed not? And but for a decisive word (gone forth already), it would have been judged between them. Lo! for wrong-doers is a painful doom. ^qPickthall4221


Or have they associates who have laid down for them as religion that for which God gave not leave? But for the Word of Decision, it had been decided between them. For the evildoers there awaits a painful chastisement. ^qArberry4221

[In that life to come,] thou wilt see the evil­doers full of fear at [the thought of] what they have earned: for [now] it is bound to fall back upon them. And in the flowering meadows of the gardens [of paradise thou wilt see] those who have attained to faith and done righteous deeds: all that they might desire shall they have with their Sustainer: [and] this, this is the great bounty – ^qAsad4222


Thou seest the wrong-doers fearful of that which they have earned, and it will surely befall them, while those who believe and do good works (will be) in flowering meadows of the Gardens, having what they wish from their Lord. This is the great preferment. ^qPickthall4222


Thou seest the evildoers going in fear of that they have earned, that is about to fall on them; but those who believe and do righteous deeds are in Meadows of the Gardens; whatsoever they will they shall have with their Lord; that is the great bounty. ^qArberry4222

that [bounty] whereof God gives the glad tiding to such of His servants as attain to faith and do righteous deeds. Say [O Prophet]: “No reward do I ask of you for this [message] other than [that you should] love your fellow-men.” For, if anyone gains [the merit of] a good deed, We shall grant him through it an increase of good: and, verily, God is much-forgiving, ever responsive to gratitude. ^qAsad4223


This it is which Allah announceth unto His bondmen who believe and do good works. Say (O Muhammad, unto mankind): I ask of you no fee therefor, save lovingkindness among kinsfolk. And whoso scoreth a good deed We add unto its good for him. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Responsive. ^qPickthall4223


That is the good tidings God gives to His servants who believe and do righteous deeds. Say: 'I do not ask of you a wage for this, except love for the kinsfolk; and whosoever gains a good deed, We shall give him increase of good in respect of it. Surely God is All-forgiving, All-thankful. ^qArberry4223

DO THEY, perchance, say, “[Muhammad] has attri­buted his own lying inventions to God”? But then, had God so willed, He could have sealed thy heart [forever]: for God blots out all falsehood, and by His words proves the truth to be true. Verily, He has full knowledge of what is in the hearts [of men]; ^qAsad4224


Or say they: He hath invented a lie concerning Allah? If Allah willed, He could have sealed thy heart (against them). And Allah will wipe out the lie and will vindicate the truth by His words. Lo! He is Aware of what is hidden in the breasts (of men). ^qPickthall4224


Or do they say, 'He has forged against God a lie?' But if God wills, He will set a seal on thy heart; and God blots out falsehood and verifies the truth by His words; He knows the thoughts within the breasts. ^qArberry4224

And He it is Who accepteth repentance from His bondmen, and pardoneth the evil deeds, and knoweth what ye do, ^qPickthall4225


It is He who accepts repentance from His servants, and pardons evil deeds; He knows the things you do. ^qArberry4225

and responds unto all who attain to faith and do righteous deeds; and [it is He who, in the life to come,] will give them, out of His bounty, far more [than they will have deserved], whereas for the deniers of the truth there is [but] suffering severe in store. ^qAsad4226


And accepteth those who do good works, and giveth increase unto them of His bounty. And as for disbelievers, theirs will be an awful doom. ^qPickthall4226


And He answers those who believe and do righteous deeds, and He gives them increase of His bounty. And the unbelievers -- for them awaits a terrible chastisement. ^qArberry4226

Wa law basatal laahur rizqa li'ibaadihee labaghaw fil ardi wa laakiny yunazzilu biqadarim maa yashaaa'; innahoo bi'ibaadihee Khabeerum Baseer ^qTrans4227


For, if God were to grant [in this world] abundant sustenance to [all of] His servants, they would behave on earth with wanton insolence: but as it is, He bestows [His grace] from on high in due measure, as He wills: for, verily, He is fully aware of [the needs of] His creatures, and sees them all. ^qAsad4227


And if Allah were to enlarge the provision for His slaves they would surely rebel in the earth, but He sendeth down by measure as He willeth. Lo! He is Informed, a Seer of His bondmen. ^qPickthall4227


Had God expanded His provision to His servants, they would have been insolent in the earth; but He sends down in measure whatsoever He will; surely He is aware of and sees His servants. ^qArberry4227

Wa Huwal lazee yunazzilul ghaisa mim ba'di maa qanatoo wa yanshuru rahmatah; wa Huwal Waliyyul Hameed ^qTrans4228


And it is He who sends down rain after [men] have lost all hope, and unfolds His grace [thereby]: for He alone is [their] Protector, the One to whom all praise is due. ^qAsad4228


And He it is Who sendeth down the saving rain after they have despaired, and spreadeth out His mercy. He is the Protecting Friend, the Praiseworthy. ^qPickthall4228


And it is He who sends down the rain after they have despaired, and He unfolds His mercy; He is the Protector, the All-laudable. ^qArberry4228

Wa min Aayaatihee khalqus samaawaati wal ardi wa maa bassa feehimaa min daaabbah; wa Huwa 'alaa jam'ihim izaa yashaaa'u Qadeer ^qTrans4229


And among His signs is the [very] creation of the heavens and the earth, and of all the living creatures which He has caused to multiply throughout them: and [since He has created them,] He has [also] the power to gather them [unto Him­self] whenever He wills. ^qAsad4229


And of His portents is the creation of the heaven and the earth, and of whatever beasts He hath dispersed therein. And He is Able to gather them when He will. ^qPickthall4229


And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and the crawling things He has scattered abroad in them; and He is able to gather them whenever He will. ^qArberry4229

Wa maaa asaabakum mim museebatin fabimaa kasabat aydeekum wa ya'foo 'an kaseer ^qTrans4230


Now whatever calamity may befall you [on Judgment Day] will be an outcome of what your own hands have wrought, although He pardons much; ^qAsad4230


Whatever of misfortune striketh you, it is what your right hands have earned. And He forgiveth much. ^qPickthall4230


Whatever affliction may visit you is for what you own hands have earned; and He pardons much. ^qArberry4230

Wa maaa antum bimu'jizeena fil ardi wa maa lakum min doonil laahi minw wa liyyinw wa laa naseer ^qTrans4231


and you cannot elude Him on earth, and you will have none to protect you from God [in the life to come], and none to bring you succour. ^qAsad4231


Ye cannot escape in the earth, for beside Allah ye have no protecting friend nor any helper. ^qPickthall4231


You are not able to frustrate Him in the earth; and, apart from God, you have neither protector nor helper. ^qArberry4231

And of His signs are the ships that run on the sea like landmarks; ^qArberry4232

if He so wills, He stills the wind, and then they lie motion­less on the sea’s surface - [and] herein, behold, there are messages indeed for all who are wholly patient in adversity and deeply grateful [to God]; ^qAsad4233


If He will He calmeth the wind so that they keep still upon its surface - Lo! herein verily are signs for every steadfast grateful (heart). - ^qPickthall4233


and if He wills, He stills the wind, and they remain motionless on its back. Surely in that are signs for every man enduring, thankful. ^qArberry4233

or else He may cause them to perish because of what they have wrought; and [withal,] He pardons much. ^qAsad4234


Or He causeth them to perish on account of that which they have earned - And He forgiveth much - ^qPickthall4234


Or He wrecks them for what they have earned; and He pardons much; ^qArberry4234

Wa ya'lamal lazeena yujaadiloona feee Aayaatinaa maa lahum mim mahees ^qTrans4235


And let them know, those who call Our mes­sages in question, that for them there is no escape. ^qAsad4235


And that those who argue concerning Our revelations may know they have no refuge. ^qPickthall4235


and that those who dispute concerning Our signs may know they have no asylum. ^qArberry4235

Famaa ooteetum min shai'in famataa'ul hayaatid dunyaa wa maa 'indal laahi khairunw wa abqaa lillazeena aamanoo wa 'alaa Rabbihim yatawakkaloon ^qTrans4236


AND [remember that] whatever you are given [now] is but for the [passing] enjoyment of life in this world - whereas that which is with God is far better and more enduring. [It shall be given] to all who attain to faith and in their Sustainer place their trust; ^qAsad4236


Now whatever ye have been given is but a passing comfort for the life of the world, and that which Allah hath is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord, ^qPickthall4236


Whatever thing you have been given is the enjoyment of the present life; but what is with God is better and more enduring for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord. ^qArberry4236

And those who answer the call of their Lord and establish worship, and whose affairs are a matter of counsel, and who spend of what We have bestowed on them, ^qPickthall4238

Wa jazaaa'u saiyi'atin saiyi'tum misluha faman 'afaa wa aslaha fa ajruhoo 'alal laah; innahoo laa yuhibbuz zaalimeen ^qTrans4240


But [remember that an attempt at] requiting evil may, too, become an evil: hence, whoever par­dons [his foe] and makes peace, his reward rests with God - for, verily, He does not love evildoers. ^qAsad4240


The guerdon of an ill-deed is an ill the like thereof. But whosoever pardoneth and amendeth, his wage is the affair of Allah. Lo! He loveth not wrong-doers. ^qPickthall4240


and the recompense of evil is evil the like of it; but whoso pardons and puts things right, his wage falls upon God; surely He loves not the evildoers. ^qArberry4240

Wa lamanin tasara ba'da zulmihee fa ulaaa'ika maa 'alaihim min sabeel ^qTrans4241


Yet indeed, as for any who defend themselves after having been wronged - no blame whatever attaches to them: ^qAsad4241


And whoso defendeth himself after he hath suffered wrong - for such, there is no way (of blame) against them. ^qPickthall4241


And whosoever helps himself after he has been wronged -- against them there is no way. ^qArberry4241

blame attaches but to those who oppress [other] people and behave outrageously on earth, offending against all right: for them there is grievous suffering in store! ^qAsad4242


The way (of blame) is only against those who oppress mankind, and wrongfully rebel in the earth. For such there is a painful doom. ^qPickthall4242


The way is only open against those who do wrong to the people, and are insolent in the earth wrongfully; there awaits them a painful chastisement. ^qArberry4242

Wa laman sabara wa ghafara inna zaalika lamin 'azmil umoor ^qTrans4243


But withal, if one is patient in adversity and forgives - this, behold, is indeed something to set one’s heart upon! ^qAsad4243


And verily whoso is patient and forgiveth - lo! that, verily, is (of) the steadfast heart of things. ^qPickthall4243


But surely he who bears patiently and is forgiving -- surely that is true constancy. ^qArberry4243

AND [thus it is:] he whom God lets go astray has henceforth no protector whatever: and so thou wilt see such evildoers [on Judgment Day, and wilt hear how] they exclaim as soon as they behold the suffering [that awaits them], “Is there any way of return?” ^qAsad4244


He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no protecting friend after Him. And thou (Muhammad) wilt see the evil-doers when they see the doom, (how) they say: Is there any way of return? ^qPickthall4244


Whomsoever God leads astray, he has no protector after him; and thou shalt see the evildoers, when they see the chastisement, saying, 'Is there any way to be sent back?' ^qArberry4244

And thou wilt see them exposed to that [doom], humbling themselves in abasement, looking [around] with a furtive glance - the while those who had attained to faith will say, “Verily, lost on [this] Day of Resurrection are they who have squandered their own and their followers’ selves!” Oh, verily, the evildoers will fall into long-lasting suffering, ^qAsad4245


And thou wilt see them exposed to (the Fire), made humble by disgrace, and looking with veiled eyes. And those who believe will say: Lo! the (eternal) losers are they who lose themselves and their housefolk on the Day of Resurrection. Lo! are not the wrong-doers in perpetual torment? ^qPickthall4245


And thou shalt see them, as they are exposed to it, abject in humbleness, looking with furtive glance; and the believers shall say, 'Surely the losers are they who lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection; surely the evildoers are in lasting chastisement. ^qArberry4245

And they will have no protecting friends to help them instead of Allah. He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no road. ^qPickthall4246


They have no protectors to help them, apart from God, and whomsoever God leads astray, no way has he.' ^qArberry4246

[Hence, O men,] respond to your Sustainer before there comes, at God’s behest, a Day on which there will be no turning back: [for] on that Day you will have no place of refuge, and neither will you be able to deny aught [of the wrong that you have done]. ^qAsad4247


Answer the call of your Lord before there cometh unto you from Allah a Day which there is no averting. Ye have no refuge on that Day, nor have a ye any (power of) refusal. ^qPickthall4247


Answer your Lord, before there comes a day from God that cannot be turned back; upon that day you shall have no shelter, no denial. ^qArberry4247

BUT IF they turn away [from thee, O Prophet, know that] We have not sent thee to be their keeper: thou art not bound to do more than deliver the message [entrusted to thee]. And, behold, [such as turn away from Our mes­sages are but impelled by the weakness and incon­stancy of human nature: thus,] when We give man a taste of Our grace, he is prone to exult in it; but if misfortune befalls [any of] them in result of what their own hands have sent forth, then, behold, man shows how bereft he is of all gratitude! ^qAsad4248


But if they are averse, We have not sent thee as a warder over them. Thine is only to convey (the message). And lo! when We cause man to taste of mercy from Us he exulteth therefor. And if some evil striketh them because of that which their own hands have sent before, then lo! man is an ingrate. ^qPickthall4248


But if they turn away, We sent thee not to be a guardian over them. It is for thee only to deliver the Message. And when We let man taste mercy from Us, he rejoices in it; but if some evil befalls him for that his own hands have forwarded, then surely man is unthankful. ^qArberry4248

God’s alone is the dominion over the heavens and the earth. He creates whatever He wills: He bestows the gift of female offspring on whomever He wills, and the gift of male offspring on whomever He wills; ^qAsad4249


Unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He createth what He will. He bestoweth female (offspring) upon whom He will, and bestoweth male (offspring) upon whom He will; ^qPickthall4249


To God belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He creates what He will; He gives to whom He will females, and He gives to whom He will males ^qArberry4249

Or He mingleth them, males and females, and He maketh barren whom He will. Lo! He is Knower, Powerful. ^qPickthall4250


or He couples them, both males and females; and He makes whom He will barren. Surely He is All-knowing, All-powerful. ^qArberry4250

And it is not given to mortal man that God should speak unto him otherwise than through sudden inspiration, or [by a voice, as it were,] from behind a veil, or by sending an apostle to reveal, by His leave, whatever He wills [to reveal]: for, verily, He is exalted, wise. ^qAsad4251


And it was not (vouchsafed) to any mortal that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation or from behind a veil, or (that) He sendeth a messenger to reveal what He will by His leave. Lo! He is Exalted, Wise. ^qPickthall4251


It belongs not to any mortal that God should speak to him, except by revelation, or from behind a veil, or that He should send a messenger and he reveal whatsoever He will, by His leave; surely He is All-high, All-wise. ^qArberry4251

And thus have We inspired in thee (Muhammad) a Spirit of Our command. Thou knewest not what the Scripture was, nor what the Faith. But We have made it a light whereby We guide whom We will of Our bondmen. And lo! thou verily dost guide unto a right path, ^qPickthall4252


Even so We have revealed to thee a Spirit of Our bidding. Thou knewest not what the Book was, nor belief; but We made it a light, whereby We guide whom We will of Our servants. And thou, surely thou shalt guide unto a straight path -- ^qArberry4252
