NONE BUT THOSE who are bent on denying the truth would call God’s messages in question. But let it not deceive thee that they seem to be able to do as they please on earth: ^qAsad404


None argue concerning the revelations of Allah save those who disbelieve, so let not their turn of fortune in the land deceive thee (O Muhammad). ^qPickthall404


None but the unbelievers dispute concerning the signs of God; so let not their going to and fro in the land delude thee. ^qArberry404

to the truth gave the lie, before their time, the people of Noah and, after them, all those [others] who were leagued together [against God’s message-bearers]; and each of those com­munities schemed against the apostle sent unto them, aiming to lay hands on him; and they contended [against his message] with fallacious arguments, so as to render void the truth thereby: but then I took them to task - and how awesome was My retribution! ^qAsad405


The folk of Noah and the factions after them denied (their messengers) before these, and every nation purposed to seize their messenger and argued falsely, (thinking) thereby to refute the Truth. Then I seized them, and how (awful) was My punishment. ^qPickthall405


The people of Noah before them also cried lies, and the parties after them; every nation purposed against their Messenger to seize him, and disputed with falsehood that they might rebut thereby the truth. Then I seized them; and how was My retribution! ^qArberry405

THEY WHO BEAR [within themselves the knowl­edge of] the throne of [God’s] almightiness, as well as all who are near it, extol their Sustainer’s limitless glory and praise, and have faith in Him, and ask forgiveness for all [others] who have attained to faith: “O our Sustainer! Thou embracest all things within [Thy] grace and knowledge: forgive, then, their sins unto those who repent and follow Thy path, and preserve them from suffering through the blazing fire! ^qAsad407


Those who bear the Throne, and all who are round about it, hymn the praises of their Lord and believe in Him and ask forgiveness for those who believe (saying): Our Lord! Thou comprehendest all things in mercy and knowledge, therefor forgive those who repent and follow Thy way. Ward off from them the punishment of hell. ^qPickthall407


Those who bear the Throne, and those round about it proclaim the praise of their Lord, and believe in Him, and they ask forgiveness for those who believe: 'Our Lord, Thou embracest every thing in mercy and knowledge; therefore forgive those who have repented, and follow Thy way, and guard them against the chastisement of Hell. ^qArberry407

“And, O our Sustainer, bring them into the gardens of perpetual bliss which Thou hast promised them, together with the righteous from among their forebears, and their spouses, and their offspring - for, verily, Thou alone art almighty, truly wise – ^qAsad408


Our Lord! And make them enter the Gardens of Eden which thou hast promised them, with such of their fathers and their wives and their descendants as do right. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty, the Wise. ^qPickthall408


Our Lord, and admit them to the Gardens of Eden that Thou hast promised them and those who were righteous of their fathers, and their wives, and their seed; surely Thou art the All-mighty, the All-wise. ^qArberry408

Wa qihimus saiyi-aat; wa man taqis saiyi-aati Yawma'izin faqad rahimtah; wa zaalika huwal fawzul 'azeem ^qTrans409


and preserve them from [doing] evil deeds: for anyone whom on that Day [of Judgment] Thou wilt have preserved from [the taint of] evil deeds, him wilt Thou have graced with Thy mercy: and that, that will be the triumph supreme!” ^qAsad409


And ward off from them ill-deeds; and he from whom Thou wardest off ill-deeds that day, him verily hast Thou taken into mercy. That is the supreme triumph. ^qPickthall409


And guard them against evil deeds; whomsoever Thou guardest against evil deeds on that day, on him Thou hast had mercy; and that is indeed the mighty triumph. ^qArberry409

Innal lazeena kafaroo yunaadawna lamaqtul laahi akbaru mim maqtikum anfusakum iz tud'awna ilal eemaani fatakfuroon ^qTrans4010


[But,] behold, as for those who are bent on denying the truth - [on that same Day] a voice will call out unto them: “Indeed, greater than your [present] loathing of yourselves was God’s loathing of you [at the time] when you were called unto faith but went on denying the truth!” ^qAsad4010


Lo! (on that day) those who disbelieve are informed by proclamation: Verily Allah's abhorrence is more terrible than your abhorrence one of another, when ye were called unto the faith but did refuse. ^qPickthall4010


It shall be proclaimed to the unbelievers, 'Surely God's hatred is greater than your hatred one of another, when you were called unto belief, and disbelieved.' ^qArberry4010

# 11

Qaaloo Rabbanaaa amat tanasnataini wa ahyaitanas nataini fa'tarafnaa bizunoo binaa fahal ilaa khuroojim min sabeel ^qTrans4011


[Whereupon] they will exclaim: “O our Sus­tainer! Twice hast Thou caused us to die, just as twice Thou hast brought us to life! ^qAsad4011


They say: Our Lord! Twice hast Thou made us die, and twice hast Thou made us live. Now we confess our sins. Is there any way to go out? ^qPickthall4011


They shall say, 'Our Lord, Thou hast caused us to die two deaths and Thou hast given us twice to live; now we confess our sins. Is there any way to go forth?' ^qArberry4011

Zaalikum bi annahooo izaa du'iyal laahu wahdahoo kafartum wa iny yushrak bihee tu'minoo; falhukmu lillaahil 'Aliyyil Kabeer ^qTrans4012


[And they will be told:] “This [has befallen you] because, whenever the One God was invoked, you denied this truth; whereas, when divinity was ascribed to aught beside Him, you believed [in it]! But all judgment rests with God, the Exalted, the Great!” ^qAsad4012


(It is said unto them): This is (your plight) because, when Allah only was invoked, ye disbelieved, but when some partner was ascribed to Him ye were believing. But the command belongeth only to Allah, the Sublime, the Majestic. ^qPickthall4012


That is because, when God was called to alone, you disbelieved; but if others are associated with Him, then you believe. Judgment belongs to God, the All-high, the All-great. ^qArberry4012

# 13

Huwal lazee yureekum Aayaatihee wa yunazzilu lakum minas samaaa'i rizqaa; wa maa tatazakkaru illaa mai yuneeb ^qTrans4013


HE IT IS who shows you His wonders [in all nature], and sends down sustenance for you from the sky: but none bethinks himself [thereof] save those who are wont to turn to God. ^qAsad4013


He it is Who showeth you His portents, and sendeth down for you provision from the sky. None payeth heed save him who turneth (unto Him) repentant. ^qPickthall4013


It is He who shows you His signs and sends down to you out of heaven provision; yet none remembers but he who repents. ^qArberry4013

# 14

Fad'ul laaha mukhliseena lahud deena wa law karihal kaafiroon ^qTrans4014


Invoke, then, God, sincere in your faith in Him alone, however hateful this may be to those who deny the truth! ^qAsad4014


Therefor (O believers) pray unto Allah, making religion pure for Him (only), however much the disbelievers be averse - ^qPickthall4014


So call unto God, making your religion His sincerely, though the unbelievers be averse. ^qArberry4014

# 15

Rafee'ud darajaati zul 'Arshi yulqir rooha min amrihee 'alaa mai yashaaa'u min 'ibaadihee liyunzira yawmat talaaq ^qTrans4015


High above all orders [of being] is He, in almightiness enthroned. By His Own will does He bestow inspiration upon whomever He wills of His servants, so as to warn [all human beings of the coming] of the Day when they shall meet Him ^qAsad4015


The Exalter of Ranks, the Lord of the Throne. He causeth the Spirit of His command upon whom He will of His slaves, that He may warn of the Day of Meeting, ^qPickthall4015


Exalter of ranks is He, Possessor of the Throne, casting the Spirit of His bidding upon whomever He will of His servants, that he may warn them of the Day of Encounter, ^qArberry4015

# 16

Yawma hum baarizoona laa yakhfaa 'alal laahi minhum shai; limanil mulkul Yawma lillaahil Waahidil Qahaar ^qTrans4016


the Day when they shall come forth [from death], with nothing of themselves hidden from God. With whom will sovereignty rest on that Day? With God, the One who holds absolute sway over all that exists! ^qAsad4016


The day when they come forth, nothing of them being hidden from Allah. Whose is the Sovereignty this day? It is Allah's, the One, the Almighty. ^qPickthall4016


the day they sally forth, and naught of theirs is hidden from God. 'Whose is' the Kingdom today?' 'God's, the One, the Omnipotent. ^qArberry4016

# 17

Al-Yawma tujzaa kullu nafsim bimaa kasabat; laa zulmal Yawm; innal laaha saree'ul hisaab ^qTrans4017


On that Day will every human being be requited for what he has earned: no wrong [will be done] on that Day: verily, swift in reckoning is God! ^qAsad4017


This day is each soul requited that which it hath earned; no wrong (is done) this day. Lo! Allah is swift at reckoning. ^qPickthall4017


Today each soul shall be recompensed for that it has earned; no wrong today. Surely God is swift at the reckoning.' ^qArberry4017

# 18

Wa anzirhum yawmal aazifati izil quloobu ladal hanaajiri kaazimeen; maa lizzaalimeena min hameeminw wa laa shafee'iny-yutaa' ^qTrans4018


Hence, warn them of that Day which draws ever nearer, when the hearts will chokingly come up to the throats: no loving friend will the evildoers have, nor any intercessor who would be heeded: ^qAsad4018


Warn them (O Muhammad) of the Day of the approaching (doom), when the hearts will be choking the throats, (when) there will be no friend for the wrong-doers, nor any intercessor who will be heard. ^qPickthall4018


And warn them against the Day of the Imminent when, choking with anguish, the hearts are in the throats and the evildoers have not one loyal friend, no intercessor to be heeded. ^qArberry4018

# 19

Ya'lamu khaaa'inatal a'yuni wa maa tukhfis sudoor ^qTrans4019


[for] He is aware of the [most] stealthy glance, and of all that the hearts would conceal. ^qAsad4019


He knoweth the traitor of the eyes, and that which the bosoms hide. ^qPickthall4019


He knows the treachery of the eyes and what the breasts conceal. ^qArberry4019

# 20

Wallaahu yaqdee bilhaqq, wallazeena yad'oona min doonihee laa yaqdoona bishai'; innal laaha Huwas Samee'ul Baseer ^qTrans4020


And God will judge in accordance with truth and justice, whereas those [beings] whom they invoke beside Him cannot judge at all: for, verily, God alone is all-hearing, all-seeing. ^qAsad4020


Allah judgeth with truth, while those to whom they cry instead of Him judge not at all. Lo! Allah, He is the Hearer, the Seer. ^qPickthall4020


God shall decide justly, and those they call on, apart from Him, shall not decide by any means. surely God is the All-hearing, the All-seeing. ^qArberry4020

# 21

Awalam yaseeroo fil ardi fa yanzuroo kaifa kaana 'aaqibatul lazeena kaanoo min qablihim; kaanoo hum ashadda minhum quwwatanw wa aasaaran fil ardi fa akhazahumul laahu bizunoobihim wa maa kaana lahum minal laahi minw waaq ^qTrans4021


Have they, then, never journeyed about the earth and beheld what happened in the end to those [deniers of the truth] who lived before their time? Greater were they in power than they are, and in the impact which they left on earth: but God took them to task for their sins, and they had none to defend them against God: ^qAsad4021


Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those who disbelieved before them? They were mightier than these in power and (in the) traces (which they left behind them) in the earth. Yet Allah seized them for their sins, and they had no protector from Allah. ^qPickthall4021


What, have they not journeyed in the land and beheld how was the end of those before them? They were stronger than themselves in might and left firmer traces in the earth; yet God seized them in their sins, and they had none to defend them from God. ^qArberry4021

# 22

Zaalika bi annahum kaanat taateehim Rusuluhum bilbaiyinaati fakafaroo fa akhazahumul laah; innahoo qawiyyun shadeedul 'iqaab ^qTrans4022


this, because their apostles had come to them with all evidence of the truth, and yet they rejected it: and so God took them to task - for, verily, He is powerful, severe in retribution! ^qAsad4022


That was because their messengers kept bringing them clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty) but they disbelieved; so Allah seized them. Lo! He is Strong, severe in punishment. ^qPickthall4022


That was because their Messengers came to them with the clear signs; but they disbelieved, so God seized them. Surely He is All-strong, terrible in retribution. ^qArberry4022

# 23

Wa laqad arsalnaa Moosaa bi Aayaatinaa wa sultaanim mubeen ^qTrans4023


THUS, INDEED, did We send Moses with Our mes­sages and a manifest authority [from Us] ^qAsad4023


And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations and a clear warrant ^qPickthall4023


We also sent Moses with Our signs and a clear authority, ^qArberry4023

# 24

Ilaa Fir'awna wa Haamaana qa Qaaroona faqaaloo saahirun kazzaab ^qTrans4024


unto Pharaoh, and Haman, and Qarun; but they [only] said, “A spellbinder is he, a liar!” ^qAsad4024


Unto Pharaoh and Haman and Korah, but they said: A lying sorcerer! ^qPickthall4024


to Pharaoh, Haman and Korah; they said, 'A lying sorcerer!' ^qArberry4024

# 25

Falamuna jaaa'ahum bil haqqi min 'indinaa qaaluq tulooo abnaaa'al lazeena aamanoo ma'ahoo wastahyoo nisaaa'ahum; wa maa kaidul kaafireena illaa fee dalaal ^qTrans4025


Now [as for Pharaoh and his followers,] when he came to them, setting forth the truth from Us, they said, “Slay the sons of those who share his beliefs, and spare [only] their women!” - but the guile of those deniers of the truth could not lead to aught but failure. ^qAsad4025


And when he brought them the Truth from Our presence, they said: Slay the sons of those who believe with him, and spare their women. But the plot of disbelievers is in naught but error. ^qPickthall4025


And when he brought them the truth from Us, they said, 'Slay the sons of those who believe with him, and spare their women.' But the guile of the unbelievers is ever in error. ^qArberry4025

# 26

Wa qaala Fir'awnu zarooneee aqtul Moosaa walyad'u Rabbahoo inneee akhaafu ai yubaddila deenakum aw ai yuzhira fil ardil fasaad ^qTrans4026


And Pharaoh said: “Leave it to me to slay Moses - and let him invoke his [alleged] sustainer! Behold, I fear lest he cause you to change your religion, or lest he cause corruption to prevail in the land!” ^qAsad4026


And Pharaoh said: Suffer me to kill Moses, and let him cry unto his Lord. Lo! I fear that he will alter your religion or that he will cause confusion in the land. ^qPickthall4026


And Pharaoh said, 'Let me slay Moses, and let him call to his Lord. I fear that he may change, your religion, or that he may cause corruption to appear in the land.' ^qArberry4026

# 27

Wa qaala Moosaaaa innee 'uztu bi Rabbee wa Rabbikum min kulli mutakabbiril laayu'minu bi Yawmil Hisaab ^qTrans4027


But Moses said: “With [Him who is] my Sus­tainer as well as your Sustainer have I indeed found refuge from everyone who, immersed in false pride, will not believe in [the coming of] the Day of Reckon­ing!” ^qAsad4027


Moses said: Lo! I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every scorner who believeth not in a Day of Reckoning. ^qPickthall4027


And Moses said, 'I take refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every man who is proud, and believes not in the Day of Reckoning.' ^qArberry4027

# 28

Wa qaala rajulum mu'minummin Aali Fir'awna yaktumu eemaanahooo ataqtuloona rajulan ai yaqoola Rabbi yal laahu wa qad jaaa'akum bil haiyinaati mir Rabbikum wa iny yaku kaaziban fa'alaihi kazi buhoo wa iny yaku saadiqany yasibkum ba'dul lazee ya'idukum innal laaha laa yahdee man huwa musrifun kaazaab ^qTrans4028


At that, a believing man of Pharaoh’s family, who [until then] had concealed his faith, exclaimed: “Would you slay a man because he says, ‘God is my Sustainer’ - seeing, withal, that he has brought you all evidence of this truth from your Sustainer? Now if he be a liar, his lie will fall back on him; but if he is a man of truth, something [of the punishment] whereof he warns you is bound to befall you: for, verily, God would not grace with His guidance one who has wasted his own self by lying [about Him]. ^qAsad4028


And a believing man of Pharaoh's family, who hid his faith, said: Would ye kill a man because he saith: My Lord is Allah, and hath brought you clear proofs from your Lord? If he is lying, then his lie is upon him; and if he is truthful, then some of that wherewith he threateneth you will strike you. Lo! Allah guideth not one who is a prodigal, a liar. ^qPickthall4028


Then said a certain man, a believer 'of Pharaoh's folk that kept hidden his belief, 'What, will you slay a man because he says, "My Lord is God," yet he has brought you the clear signs from your Lord? If he is a liar, his lying is upon his own head; but if he is truthful, somewhat of that he promises you will smite you. Surely God guides not him who is prodigal and a liar. ^qArberry4028

# 29

Yaa qawmi lakumul mulkul yawma zaahireena fil ardi famai yansurunaa mim baasil laahi in jaaa'anaa; qaala Fir'awnu maaa ureekum illaa maaa araa wa maaa ahdeekum illaa sabeelar Rashaad ^qTrans4029


“O my people! Yours is the dominion today, [and] most eminent are you on earth: but who will rescue us from God’s punishment, once it befalls us?” Said Pharaoh: “I but want to make you see what I see myself; and I would never make you follow any path but that of rectitude!” ^qAsad4029


O my people! Yours is the kingdom to-day, ye being uppermost in the land. But who would save us from the wrath of Allah should it reach us? Pharaoh said: I do but show you what I think, and I do but guide you to wise policy. ^qPickthall4029


O my people, today the kingdom is yours, who are masters in the land. But who will help us, against the might of God, if it comes upon us?' Said Pharaoh, 'I only let you see what I see; I only guide you in the way of rectitude.' ^qArberry4029

# 30

Wa qaalal lazee aamana yaa qawmi inneee akhaafu 'alaikum misla yawmil Ahzaab ^qTrans4030


Thereupon exclaimed he who had attained to faith: “O my people! Verily, I fear for you the like of what one day befell those others who were leagued together [against God’s truth] – ^qAsad4030


And he who believed said: O my people! Lo! I fear for you a fate like that of the factions (of old); ^qPickthall4030


Then said he who believed, 'My people, truly I fear for you the like of the day of the parties, ^qArberry4030

# 31

Misla daabi qawmi Noohinw wa 'aadinw wa Samooda wallazeena mim ba'dihim; wa mal laahu yureedu zulmal lil'ibaad ^qTrans4031


the like of what happened to Noah’s people, and to [the tribes of] Ad and Thamud and those who came after them! And, withal, God does not will any wrong for His crea­tures. ^qAsad4031


A plight like that of Noah's folk, and A'ad and Thamud, and those after them, and Allah willeth no injustice for (His) slaves. ^qPickthall4031


the like of the case of Noah's people, Ad, Thamood, and those after them; and God desires not wrong for His servants.' ^qArberry4031

# 32

Wa yaa qawmi inneee akhaafu 'alaikum yawmat tanaad ^qTrans4032


“And, O my people, I fear for you [the coming of] that Day of [Judgment - the Day when you will be] calling unto one another [in distress] – ^qAsad4032


And, O my people! Lo! I fear for you a Day of Summoning, ^qPickthall4032


O my people, I fear for you the Day of Invocation, ^qArberry4032

# 33

Yawma tuwalloona mud bireena maa lakum minal laahi min 'aasim; wa mai yudlilil laahu famaa lahoo min haad ^qTrans4033


the Day when you will [wish to] turn your backs and flee, having none to defend you against God: for he whom God lets go astray can never find any guide. ^qAsad4033


A day when ye will turn to flee, having no preserver from Allah: and he whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no guide. ^qPickthall4033


the day you turn about, retreating, having none to defend you from God; and whomsoever God leads astray, no guide has he. ^qArberry4033

Wa laqad jaaa'akum Yoosufu min qablu bil baiyinaati famaa ziltum fee shakkim mimaa jaaa'akum bihee hattaaa izaa halaka qultum lai yab asal laahu mim ba'dihee Rasoolaa; kazaalika yudillul laahu man huwa Musrifum murtaab ^qTrans4034


“And [remember:] it was to you that Joseph came aforetime with all evidence of the truth; but you never ceased to throw doubt on all [the messages] that he brought you - so much so that when he died, you said, ‘Never will God send any apostle [even] after him!’ “In this way God lets go astray such as waste their own selves by throwing suspicion [on His revela­tions] – ^qAsad4034


And verily Joseph brought you of old clear proofs, yet ye ceased not to be in doubt concerning what he brought you till, when he died, ye said: Allah will not send any messenger after him. Thus Allah deceiveth him who is a prodigal, a doubter. ^qPickthall4034


Joseph brought you the clear signs before, yet you continued in doubt concerning that he brought you until, when he perished, you said, "God will never send forth a Messenger after him." Even, so God leads astray the prodigal and the doubter.' ^qArberry4034

# 35

Allazeena yujaadiloona feee Aaayaatil laahi bighairi sultaanin ataahum kabura maqtan 'indal laahi wa 'indal lazeena aamanoo; kazaalika yatha'ul laahu 'alaa kulli qalbi mutakabbirin jabbaar ^qTrans4035

then it is said to them, 'Where are those you associated, apart from God?' ^qArberry4073

Beside Allah? They say: They have failed us; but we used not to pray to anything before. Thus doth Allah send astray the disbelievers (in His guidance). ^qPickthall4074


They shall say, 'They have gone astray from us; nay, but it was nothing at all that we called upon aforetime.' Even so God leads astray the unbelievers. ^qArberry4074

Zaalikum bimaa kuntum tafrahoona fil ardi bighairil haqqi wa bimaa kuntum tamrahoon ^qTrans4075


this is an out­come of your having arrogantly exulted on earth without any [concern for what is] right, and of your having been so full of self-conceit! ^qAsad4075


(And it is said unto them): This is because ye exulted in the earth without right, and because ye were petulant. ^qPickthall4075


'That is because you rejoiced in the earth without right, and were exultant. ^qArberry4075

Enter [now] the gates of hell, therein to abide: and how vile an abode for all who are given to false pride!” ^qAsad4076


Enter ye the gates of hell, to dwell therein. Evil is the habitation of the scornful. ^qPickthall4076


Enter the gates of Gehenna, to dwell therein forever.' How evil is the lodging of those that are proud! ^qArberry4076

HENCE, remain thou patient in adversity - for, verily, God’s promise always comes true. And whether We show thee [in this world] something of what We hold in store for those [deniers of the truth], or whether We cause thee to die [ere that retribution takes place - know that, in the end], it is unto Us that they will be brought back. ^qAsad4077


Then have patience (O Muhammad). Lo! the promise of Allah is true. And whether we let thee see a part of that which We promise them, or (whether) We cause thee to die, still unto Us they will be brought back. ^qPickthall4077


So be thou patient; surely God's promise is true. Whether We show thee a part of that We promise them, or We call thee unto Us, to Us they shall be returned. ^qArberry4077

And, indeed, [O Muhammad,] We sent forth apostles before thy time; some of them We have mentioned to thee, and some of them We have not mentioned to thee. And it was not given to any apostle to bring forth a miracle other than by God’s leave. Yet when God’s will becomes manifest, judgment will [already] have been passed in all justice, and lost will be, then and there, all who tried to reduce to nothing [whatever they could not understand]. ^qAsad4078


Verily We sent messengers before thee, among them those of whom We have told thee, and some of whom We have not told thee; and it was not given to any messenger that he should bring a portent save by Allah's leave, but when Allah's commandment cometh (the cause) is judged aright, and the followers of vanity will then be lost. ^qPickthall4078


We sent Messengers before thee; of some We have related to thee, and some We have not related to thee. It was not for any Messenger to bring a sign, save by God's leave. When God's command comes, justly the issue shall be decided; then the vain-doers shall be lost. ^qArberry4078

Allah it is Who hath appointed for you cattle, that ye may ride on some of them, and eat of some - ^qPickthall4079

and find [yet other] benefits in them; and that through them you may attain to the fulfillment of [many] a heartfelt need: for on them, as on ships, you are borne [through life]. ^qAsad4080


(Many) benefits ye have from them - and that ye may satisfy by their means a need that is in your breasts, and may be borne upon them as upon the ship. ^qPickthall4080


other uses also you have in them; and that on them you may attain a need in your breasts, and upon them and on the ships you are carried. ^qArberry4080

And He showeth you His tokens. Which, then, of the tokens of Allah do ye deny? ^qPickthall4081


And He shows you His signs; then which of God's signs do you reject? ^qArberry4081

HAVE THEY, then, never journeyed about the earth and beheld what happened in the end to those [deniers of the truth] who lived before their time? More numerous were they, and greater in power than they are, and in the impact which they left on earth: but all that they ever achieved was of no avail to them – ^qAsad4082


Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those before them? They were more numerous than these, and mightier in power and (in the) traces (which they left behind them) in the earth. But all that they used to earn availed them not. ^qPickthall4082


What, have they not journeyed in the land and beheld how was the end of those before them? They were stronger than themselves in might and left firmer traces in the earth; yet that they earned did not avail them. ^qArberry4082

for when their apostles came to them with all evidence of the truth, they arrogantly exulted in whatever knowledge they [already] possessed: and [so, in the end,] they were overwhelmed by the very thing which they were wont to deride. ^qAsad4083


And when their messengers brought them clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty) they exulted in the knowledge they (themselves) possessed. And that which they were wont to mock befell them. ^qPickthall4083


So, when their Messengers brought them the clear signs, they rejoiced in what knowledge they had, and were encompassed by that they mocked at. ^qArberry4083

And then, when they [clearly] beheld Our punishment, they said: “We have come to believe in the One God, and we have renounced all belief in that to which we were wont to ascribe a share in His divinity!” ^qAsad4084


Then, when they saw Our doom, they said: We believe in Allah only and reject (all) that we used to associate (with Him). ^qPickthall4084


Then, when they saw Our might, they said, 'We believe in God alone, and we disbelieve in that we were associating with Him.' ^qArberry4084

But their attaining to faith after they had beheld Our punishment could not possibly benefit them such being the way of God that has always obtained for His creatures -: and so, then and there, lost were they who had denied the truth. ^qAsad4085


But their faith could not avail them when they saw Our doom. This is Allah's law which hath ever taken course for His bondmen. And then the disbelievers will be ruined. ^qPickthall4085


But their belief when they saw Our might did not profit them -- the wont of God, as in the past, touching His servants; then the unbelievers shall be lost. ^qArberry4085
