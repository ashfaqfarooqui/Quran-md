Yaa ayyuhal lazeena aamanoo la tuqaddimoo baina yada yil laahi wa Rasoolihee wattaqul laah; innal laaha samee'un 'Aleem ^qTrans491


O YOU who have attained to faith! Do not put yourselves forward in the presence of [what] God and His Apostle [may have ordained], but remain conscious of God: for, verily, God is all-hearing, all-knowing! ^qAsad491


O ye who believe! Be not forward in the presence of Allah and His messenger, and keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower. ^qPickthall491

Yaa ayyuhal lazeena aamanoo laa tarfa'ooo aswaatakum fawqa sawtin Nabiyi wa laa tajharoo lahoo bilqawli kajahri ba'dikum liba 'din an tahbata a 'maalukum wa antum laa tash'uroon ^qTrans492


O you who have attained to faith! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, and neither speak loudly to him, as you would speak loudly to one another, lest all your [good] deeds come to nought without your perceiving it. ^qAsad492


O ye who believe! Lift not up your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor shout when speaking to him as ye shout one to another, lest your works be rendered vain while ye perceive not. ^qPickthall492


O believers, raise not your voices above the Prophet's voice, and be not loud in your speech to him, as you are loud one to another, lest your works fail while you are not aware. ^qArberry492

Innal lazeena yaghud doona aswaatahum 'inda Rasoolil laahi ulaaa'ikal lazeenam tah anal laahu quloobahum littaqwaa; lahum maghfiratunw waajrun 'azeem ^qTrans493


Behold, they who lower their voices in the presence of God’s Apostle - it is they whose hearts God has tested [and opened] to consciousness of Himself; [and] theirs shall be forgiveness and a reward supreme. ^qAsad493


Lo! they who subdue their voices in the presence of the messenger of Allah, those are they whose hearts Allah hath proven unto righteousness. Theirs will be forgiveness and immense reward. ^qPickthall493


Surely those who lower their voices in the presence of God's Messenger, those are they whose hearts God has tested for godfearing; they shall have forgiveness and a mighty wage. ^qArberry493

Innal lazeena yunaadoo naka minw waraaa'il hujuraati aksaruhum laa ya'qiloon ^qTrans494


Verily, [O Prophet,] as for those who call thee from without thy private apartments - most of them do not use their reason: ^qAsad494


Lo! those who call thee from behind the private apartments, most of them have no sense. ^qPickthall494


Surely those who call unto thee from behind the apartments, the most of them do not understand. ^qArberry494

# 5

Wa law annahum sabaroo hatta takhruja ilaihim lakaana khairal lahum; wallaahu Ghafoorur Raheem ^qTrans495


for, if they had the patience [to wait] until thou come forth to them [of thine own accord], it would be for their own good. Still, God is much forgiving, a dispenser of grace. ^qAsad495


And if they had had patience till thou camest forth unto them, it had been better for them. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. ^qPickthall495


And if they had patience, until thou comest out to them, that would be better for them; and God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate. ^qArberry495

Yaaa ayyuhal lazeena aamanoo in jaaa'akum faasqum binaba in fatabaiyanooo an tuseeboo qawmam bijahalatin fatusbihoo 'alaa maa fa'altum naadimeen ^qTrans496


O YOU who have attained to faith! If any iniquitous person comes to you with a [slanderous] tale, use your discernment, lest you hurt people unwittingly and afterwards be filled with remorse for what you have done. ^qAsad496


O ye who believe! If an evil-liver bring you tidings, verify it, lest ye smite some folk in ignorance and afterward repent of what ye did. ^qPickthall496


O believers, if an ungodly man comes to you with a tiding, make clear, lest you afflict a people unwittingly, and then repent of what you have done. ^qArberry496

# 7

Wa'lamooo anna feekum Rasoolal laah; law yutee'ukum fee kaseerim minal amrila'anittum wa laakinnal laaha habbaba ilaikumul eemaana wa zaiyanahoo fee quloobikum wa karraha ilaikumul kufra walfusooqa wal'isyaan; ulaaaika humur raashidoon ^qTrans497


And know that God’s Apostle is among you: were he to comply with your inclinations in each and every case, you would be bound to come to harm [as a community]. But as it is, God has caused [your] faith to be dear to you, and has given it beauty in your hearts, and has made hateful to you all denial of the truth, and all iniquity, and all rebellion [against what is good]. Such indeed are they who follow the right course ^qAsad497


And know that the messenger of Allah is among you. If he were to obey you in much of the government, ye would surely be in trouble; but Allah hath endeared the faith to you and hath beautified it in your hearts, and hath made disbelief and lewdness and rebellion hateful unto you. Such are they who are the rightly guided. ^qPickthall497


And know that the Messenger of God is among you. If he obeyed you in much of the affair, you would suffer; but God has endeared to you belief, decking it fair in your hearts, and He has made detestable to you unbelief and ungodliness and disobedience. Those -- they are the right-minded, ^qArberry497

Fadlam minal laahi wa ni'mah; wallaahu 'Aleemun Hakeem ^qTrans498


through God’s bounty and favour; and God is all-knowing, truly wise. ^qAsad498


(It is) a bounty and a grace from Allah; and Allah is Knower, Wise. ^qPickthall498


by God's favour and blessing; God is All-knowing, All-wise. ^qArberry498

Wa in taaa'ifataani minal mu'mineenaq tataloo faaslihoo bainahumaa fa-im baghat ih daahumaa 'alal ukhraa faqaatilul latee tabhee hattaa tafeee'a ilaaa amril laah; fa-in faaa't fa aslihoo bainahumaa bil'adli wa aqsitoo innal laaha yuhibbul muqsiteen ^qTrans499


Hence, if two groups of believers fall to fighting, make peace between them; but then, if one of the two [groups] goes on acting wrongfully towards the other, fight against the one that acts wrongfully until it reverts to God’s commandment; and if they revert, make peace between them with justice, and deal equitably [with them]: for verily, God loves those who act equitably! ^qAsad499


And if two parties of believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them. And if one party of them doeth wrong to the other, fight ye that which doeth wrong till it return unto the ordinance of Allah; then, if it return, make peace between them justly, and act equitably. Lo! Allah loveth the equitable. ^qPickthall499


If two parties of the believers fight, put things right between them; then, if one of them is insolent against the other, fight the insolent one till it reverts to God's commandment. If it reverts, set things right between them equitably, and be just. Surely God loves the just. ^qArberry499

Innamal mu'minoona ikhwatun fa aslihoo baina akhawaykum wattaqul laaha la'allakum tuhamoon ^qTrans4910


All believers are but brethren. Hence, [when­ever they are at odds,] make peace between your two brethren, and remain conscious of God, so that you might be graced with His mercy. ^qAsad4910


The believers are naught else than brothers. Therefore make peace between your brethren and observe your duty to Allah that haply ye may obtain mercy. ^qPickthall4910


The believers indeed are brothers; so set things right between your two brothers, and fear God; haply so you will find mercy. ^qArberry4910

Yaaa ayyuhal lazeena aamanoo laa yaskhar qawmum min qawmin 'asaaa anyyakoonoo khairam minhum wa laa nisaaa'um min nisaaa'in 'Asaaa ay yakunna khairam minhunna wa laa talmizooo bil alqaab; bi'sal ismul fusooqu ba'dal eemaan; wa mal-lam yatub fa-ulaaa'ika humuz zaalimoon ^qTrans4911


O YOU who have attained to faith! No men shall deride [other] men: it may well be that those [whom they deride] are better than themselves; and no women [shall deride other] women: it may well be that those [whom they deride] are better than them­selves. And neither shall you defame one another, nor insult one another by [opprobrious] epithets: evil is all imputation of iniquity after [one has attained to] faith; and they who [become guilty thereof and] do not repent - it is they, they who are evildoers! ^qAsad4911


O ye who believe! Let not a folk deride a folk who may be better than they (are), not let women (deride) women who may be better than they are; neither defame one another, nor insult one another by nicknames. Bad is the name of lewdness after faith. And whoso turneth not in repentance, such are evil-doers. ^qPickthall4911


O believers, let not any people scoff at another people who may be better than they; neither let women scoff at women who may be better than themselves. And find not fault with one another, neither revile one another by nicknames. An evil name is ungodliness after belief. And whoso repents not, those -- they are the evildoers. ^qArberry4911

Yaaa ayyuhal lazeena aamanuj taniboo kaseeram minaz zanni inna ba'daz zanniismunw wa laa tajassasoo wa la yaghtab ba'dukum ba'daa; a yuhibbu ahadukum any yaakula lahma akheehi maitan fakarih tumooh; wattaqul laa; innal laaha tawwaabur Raheem ^qTrans4912


O you who have attained to faith! Avoid most guesswork [about one another] for, behold, some of [such] guesswork is [in itself] a sin; and do not spy upon one another, and neither allow your­selves to speak ill of one another behind your backs. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? Nay, you would loathe it! And be conscious of God. Verily, God is an accep­tor of repentance, a dispenser of grace! ^qAsad4912


O ye who believe! Shun much suspicion; for lo! some suspicion is a crime. And spy not, neither backbite one another. Would one of you love to eat the flesh of his dead brother? Ye abhor that (so abhor the other)! And keep your duty (to Allah). Lo! Allah is Relenting, Merciful. ^qPickthall4912


O believers, eschew much suspicion; some suspicion is a sin. And do not spy, neither backbite one another; would any of you like to eat the flesh of his brother dead? You would abominate it. And fear you God; assuredly God turns, and He is All-compassionate. ^qArberry4912

Yaaa ayyuhan naasu innaa khalaqnaakum min zakarinw wa unsaa wa ja'alnaakum shu'oobanw wa qabaaa'ila lita'aarafoo inna akramakum 'indal laahi atqaakum innal laaha 'Aleemun khabeer ^qTrans4913


O men! Behold, We have created you all out of a male and a female, and have made you into nations and tribes, so that you might come to know one another. Verily, the noblest of you in the sight of God is the one who is most deeply conscious of Him. Behold, God is all-knowing, all-aware. ^qAsad4913


O mankind! Lo! We have created you male and female, and have made you nations and tribes that ye may know one another. Lo! the noblest of you, in the sight of Allah, is the best in conduct. Lo! Allah is Knower, Aware. ^qPickthall4913


O mankind, We have created you male and female, and appointed you races and tribes, that you may know one another. Surely the noblest among you in the sight of God is the most godfearing of you. God is All-knowing, All-aware. ^qArberry4913

Qaalatil-A 'raabu aamannaa qul lam tu'minoo wa laakin qoolooo aslamnaa wa lamma yadkhulil eemaanu fee quloobikum wa in tutee'ul laaha wa Rasoolahoo laa yalitkum min a'maalikum shai'aa; innal laaha Ghafoorur Raheem ^qTrans4914


THE BEDOUIN say, “We have attained to faith.” Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: “You have not [yet] attained to faith; you should [rather] say, ‘We have [outwardly] surrendered’ - for [true] faith has not yet entered your hearts. But if you [truly] pay heed unto God and His Apostle, He will not let the least of your deeds go to waste: for, behold, God is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace.” ^qAsad4914


The wandering Arabs say: We believe. Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Ye believe not, but rather say "We submit," for the faith hath not yet entered into your hearts. Yet, if ye obey Allah and His messenger, He will not withhold from you aught of (the reward of) your deeds. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. ^qPickthall4914


The Bedouins say, 'We believe.' Say: 'You do not believe; rather say, "We surrender"; for belief has not yet entered your hearts. If you obey God and His Messenger, He will not diminish you anything of your works. God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.' ^qArberry4914

# 15

Innamal muu'minoonal lazeena aamanoo billaahi wa Rasoolihee summa lam yartaaboo wa jaahadoo biamwaalihim wa anfusihim fee sabeelil laah; ulaaaika humus saadiqoon ^qTrans4915


[Know that true] believers are only those who have attained to faith in God and His Apostle and have left all doubt behind, and who strive hard in God’s cause with their possessions and their lives: it is they, they who are true to their word! ^qAsad4915


The (true) believers are those only who believe in Allah and His messenger and afterward doubt not, but strive with their wealth and their lives for the cause of Allah. Such are the sincere. ^qPickthall4915


The believers are those who believe in God and His Messenger, then have not doubted, and have struggled with their possessions and their selves in the way of God; those -- they are the truthful ones. ^qArberry4915

# 16

Qul atu'allimoonal laaha bideenikum wallaahu ya'lamu maa fis samaawaati wa maa fil ard; wallaahu bikulli shai'in 'Aleem ^qTrans4916


Say: “Do you, perchance, [want to] inform God of [the nature of] your faith although God knows all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth? Indeed, God has full knowledge of every­thing!” ^qAsad4916


Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Would ye teach Allah your religion, when Allah knoweth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and Allah is Aware of all things? ^qPickthall4916


Say: 'What, would you teach God what your religion is, and God knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth? And God has knowledge of everything.' ^qArberry4916

Yamunnoona 'alaika an aslamoo qul laa tamunnoo 'alaiya Islaamakum balillaahu yamunnu 'alaikum an hadaakum lil eemaani in kuntum saadiqeen ^qTrans4917


Many people think that they have bestowed a favour upon thee [O Prophet] by having surrendered [to thee]. Say thou: “Deem not your surrender a favour unto me: nay, but it is God who bestows a favour upon you by showing you the way to faith - if you are true to your word!” ^qAsad4917


They make it a favour unto thee (Muhammad) that they have surrendered (unto Him). Say: Deem not your Surrender a favour unto me; but Allah doth confer a favour on you, inasmuch as He hath led you to the Faith, if ye are earnest. ^qPickthall4917


They count it as a favour to thee that they have surrendered! Say: 'Do not count your surrendering as a favour to me; nay, but rather God confers a favour upon you, in that He has guided you to belief, if it be that you are truthful. ^qArberry4917

# 18

Innal laaha ya'lamu ghaibas samaawaati wal ard; wallaahu baseerum bimaa ta'maloon ^qTrans4918


Verily, God knows the hidden reality of the heavens and the earth; and God sees all that you do. ^qAsad4918


Lo! Allah knoweth the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Seer of what ye do. ^qPickthall4918


God knows the Unseen of the heavens and of the earth; and God sees the things you do.' ^qArberry4918
