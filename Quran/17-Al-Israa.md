LIMITLESS in His glory is He who transported His servant by night from the Inviolable House of Worship [at Mecca] to the Remote House of Worship [, at Jerusalem] - the environs of which We had blessed -so that We might show him some of Our symbols: for, verily, He alone is all-hearing, all-seeing. ^qAsad171


Glorified be He Who carried His servant by night from the Inviolable Place of Worship to the Far distant place of worship the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, that We might show him of Our tokens! Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the Seer. ^qPickthall171

Wa aatainaa Moosal-Kitaaba wa ja'alnaahu hudal-liBaneee Israaa'eel; ^qTrans172


And [thus, too,] We vouchsafed revelation unto Moses, and made it a [source of] guidance for the children of Israel, [commanding them:] "Do not ascribe to any but Me the power to determine your fate, ^qAsad172


We gave unto Moses the Scripture, and We appointed it a guidance for the children of Israel, saying: Choose no guardian beside Me. ^qPickthall172


And We gave Moses the Book, and made it a guidance to the Children of Israel: 'Take not unto yourselves any guardian apart from Me.' ^qArberry172

O you descendants of those whom We caused to be borne (in the ark] with Noah! Behold, he was a most grateful servant (of Ours]!" ^qAsad173


(They were) the seed of those whom We carried (in the ship) along with Noah. Lo! he was a grateful slave. ^qPickthall173

Wa qadainaaa ilaa Baneee Israaa'eela fil Kitaabi latufsidunna fil ardi marratain; wa lata'lunna'uluwwan kabeeraa ^qTrans174


And we made [this] known to the children of Israel through revelation: Twice, indeed, will you spread corruption on earth and will indeed become grossly overbearing! ^qAsad174


And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Scripture: Ye verily will work corruption in the earth twice, and ye will become great tyrants. ^qPickthall174


And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Book: 'You shall do corruption in the earth twice, and you shall ascend exceeding high.' ^qArberry174

Hence, when the prediction of the first of those two [periods of iniquity] came true, We sent against you some of Our bondmen of terrible prowess in war, and they wrought havoc throughout the land: and so the prediction was fulfilled. ^qAsad175


So when the time for the first of the two came, We roused against you slaves of Ours of great might who ravaged (your) country, and it was a threat performed. ^qPickthall175


So, when the promise of the first of these came to pass, We sent against you servants of Ours, men of great might, and they went through the habitations, and it was a promise performed. ^qArberry175

Summa radadnaa lakumul karrata 'alaihim wa amdad-naakum-bi amwaalinuw wa baneen; wa ja'alnaakum aksara nafeeraa ^qTrans176


And after a time We allowed you to prevail against them once again, and aided you with wealth and offspring, and made you more numerous [than ever]. ^qAsad176


Then we gave you once again your turn against them, and We aided you with wealth and children and made you more in soldiery. ^qPickthall176


Then We gave back to you the turn to prevail over them, and We succoured you with wealth and children, and We made you a greater host. ^qArberry176

[And We said:] "If you persevere in doing good, you will but be doing good to yourselves; and if you do evil, it will be [done] to yourselves." And so, when the prediction of the second [period of your iniquity] came true, [We raised new enemies against you, and allowed them] to disgrace you utterly, and to enter the Temple as [their forerunners] had entered it once before, and to destroy with utter destruction all that they had conquered. ^qAsad177


(Saying): If ye do good, ye do good for your own souls, and if ye do evil, it is for them (in like manner). So, when the time for the second (of the judgments) came (We roused against you others of Our slaves) to ravage you, and to enter the Temple even as they entered it the first time, and to lay waste all that they conquered with an utter wasting. ^qPickthall177


'If you do good, it is your own souls you do good to, and if you do evil it is to them likewise.' Then, when the promise of the second came to pass, We sent against you Our servants to discountenance you, and to enter the Temple, as they entered it the first time, and to destroy utterly that which they ascended to. ^qArberry177

'Asaa rabbukum anyyarhamakum; wa in 'uttum 'udnaa; wa ja'alnaa jahannama lilkaafireena haseera ^qTrans178


Your Sustainer may well show mercy unto you; but if you revert [to sinning], We shall revert [to chastising you]. And [remember this:] We have ordained that [in the hereafter] hell shall close upon all who deny the truth. ^qAsad178


It may be that your Lord will have mercy on you, but if ye repeat (the crime) We shall repeat (the punishment), and We have appointed hell a dungeon for the disbelievers. ^qPickthall178


Perchance your Lord will have mercy upon you; but if you return, We shall return; and We have made Gehenna a prison for the unbelievers. ^qArberry178

VERILY, this Qur'an shows the way to all that is most upright, and gives the believers who do good deeds the glad tiding that theirs will be a great reward; ^qAsad179


Lo! this Qur'an guideth unto that which is straightest, and giveth tidings unto the believers who do good works that theirs will be a great reward. ^qPickthall179


Surely this Koran guides to the way that is straightest and gives good tidings to the believers who do deeds of righteousness, that theirs shall be a great wage, ^qArberry179

Wa yad'ul insaanu bishsharri du'aaa 'ahoo bilkhayr; wa kaanal insaanu 'ajoola ^qTrans1711


As it is, man [often] prays for things that are bad as if he were praying for something that is good: for man is prone to be hasty [in his judgments]. ^qAsad1711


Man prayeth for evil as he prayeth for good; for man was ever hasty. ^qPickthall1711

And We have established the night and the day as two symbols; and thereupon We have effaced the symbol of night and set up [in its place] the light giving symbol of day, so that you might seek to obtain your Sustainer's bounty and be aware of the passing years and of the reckoning [that is bound to come]. For clearly, most clearly, have We spelt out everything! ^qAsad1712


And We appoint the night and the day two portents. Then We make dark the portent of the night, and We make the portent of the day sight-giving, that ye may seek bounty from your Lord, and that ye may know the computation of the years, and the reckoning; and everything have We expounded with a clear expounding. ^qPickthall1712


We have appointed the night and the day as two signs; then We have blotted out the sign of the night, and made the sign of the day to see, and that you may seek bounty from your Lord, and that you may know the number of the years, and the reckoning; and everything We have distinguished very distinctly. ^qArberry1712

Wa kulla insaanin alzamnaahu taaa'irahoo fe 'unuqihee wa nukhriji lahoo Yawmal Qiyaamati kitaabany yalqaahu manshooraa ^qTrans1713


And every human being's destiny have We tied to his neck; and on the Day of Resurrection We shall bring forth for him a record which he will find wide open; ^qAsad1713


And every man's augury have We fastened to his own neck, and We shall bring forth for him on the Day of Resurrection a book which he will find wide open. ^qPickthall1713


And every man -- We have fastened to him his bird of omen upon his neck; and We shall bring forth for him, on the Day of Resurrection, a book he shall find spread wide open. ^qArberry1713

Iqra kitaabak kafaa binafsikal Yawma 'alaika haseebaa ^qTrans1714


[and he will be told:] "Read this thy record,! Sufficient is thine own self today to make out thine account!" ^qAsad1714


(And it will be said unto him): Read thy Book. Thy soul sufficeth as reckoner against thee this day. ^qPickthall1714


'Read thy book! Thy soul suffices thee this day as a reckoner against thee.' ^qArberry1714

Manihtadaa fa innamaa yahtadee linafsihee wa man dalla fa innamaa yadillu 'alaihaa; wa laa taziru waaziratunw wizra ukhraa; wa maa kunnaa mu'azzibeena hatta nab'asa Rasoola ^qTrans1715


Whoever chooses to follow the right path, follows it but for his own good; and whoever goes astray, goes but astray to his own hurt; and no bearer of burdens shall be made to bear another" burden. Moreover. We would never chastise [any community for the wrong they may do] ere We have sent an apostle [to them]. ^qAsad1715


Whosoever goeth right, it is only for (the good of) his own soul that he goeth right, and whosoever erreth, erreth only to its hurt. No laden soul can bear another's load, We never punish until we have sent a messenger. ^qPickthall1715


Whosoever is guided, is only guided to his own gain, and whosoever goes astray, it is only to his own loss; no soul laden bears the load of another. We never chastise, until We send forth a Messenger. ^qArberry1715

Wa izaaa aradnaaa an nuhlika qaryatan amarnaa mutrafeehaa fafasaqoo feehaa fahaqqa 'alaihal qawlu fadammarnaahaa tadmeeraa ^qTrans1716


But when [this has been done, and] it is Our will to destroy a community, We convey Our last warning to those of its people who have lost themselves entirely in the pursuit of pleasures; and [if] they [continue to] act sinfully, the sentence [of doom] passed on the community takes effect, and We break it to smithereens. ^qAsad1716


And when We would destroy a township We send commandment to its folk who live at ease, and afterward they commit abomination therein, and so the Word (of doom) hath effect for it, and we annihilate it with complete annihilation. ^qPickthall1716


And when We desire to destroy a city, We command its men who live at ease, and they commit ungodliness therein, then the Word is realized against it, and We destroy it utterly. ^qArberry1716

# 17

Wa kam ahlaknaa minal qurooni mim ba'di Nooh; wa kafaa bi Rabbika bizunoobi 'ibaadihee Khabeeram Baseeraa ^qTrans1717


And how many a generation have We [thus] destroyed after [the time of] Noah! For, none has the like of thy Sustainer's awareness and insight into His creatures' sins. ^qAsad1717


How many generations have We destroyed since Noah! And Allah sufficeth as Knower and Beholder of the sins of His slaves. ^qPickthall1717


How many generations We have destroyed after Noah! Thy Lord suffices as one who is aware of and sees the sins of His servants. ^qArberry1717

Man kaana yureedul 'aajilata 'ajjalnaa lahoo feehaa maa nashaaa'u liman nureedu summa ja'alnaa lahoo Jahannama yaslaahaa mazmoomammad hooraa ^qTrans1718


Unto him who cares for [no more than the enjoyment of] this fleeting life We readily grant thereof as much as We please, [giving] to whomever it is Our will [to give]; but in the end We consign him to [the suffering of] hell; which he will have to endure disgraced and disowned! ^qAsad1718


Whoso desireth that (life) which hasteneth away, We hasten for him therein what We will for whom We please. And afterward We have appointed for him hell; he will endure the heat thereof, condemned, rejected. ^qPickthall1718


Whosoever desires this hasty world, We hasten for him therein what We will unto whomsoever We desire; then We appoint for him Gehenna wherein he shall roast, condemned and rejected. ^qArberry1718

# 19

Wa man araadal Aakhirata wa sa'aa lahaa sa'yahaa wa huwa mu'minun fa ulaaa'ika kaana sa'yuhum mashkooraa ^qTrans1719


But as for those who care for the [good of the] life to come, and strive for it as it ought to be striven for, and are [true] believers withal -they are the ones whose striving finds favour [with God]! ^qAsad1719


And whoso desireth the Hereafter and striveth for it with the effort necessary, being a believer; for such, their effort findeth favour (with their Lord). ^qPickthall1719


And whosoever desires the world to come and strives after it as he should, being a believer -- those, their striving shall be thanked. ^qArberry1719

# 20

Kullan numiddu haaa 'ulaaa'i wa haaa'ulaaa'i min 'ataaa'i rabbik; wa maa kaana 'ataaa'u rabbika mahzooraa ^qTrans1720


All [of them] -these as well as those -do We freely endow with some of thy Sustainer's gifts, since thy Sustainer's giving is never confined [to one kind of man]. ^qAsad1720


Each do We supply, both these and those, from the bounty of thy Lord. And the bounty of thy Lord can never be walled up. ^qPickthall1720


Each We succour, these and those, from thy Lord's gift; and thy Lord's gift is not confined. ^qArberry1720

# 21

Unzur kaifa faddalnaa ba'dahum 'alaa ba'd; wa lal Aakhiratu akbaru darajaatinw wa akbaru tafdeelaa ^qTrans1721


Behold how We bestow [on earth) more bounty on some of them than on others: but [remember that] the life to come will be far higher in degree and far greater in merit and bounty. ^qAsad1721


See how We prefer one of them above another, and verily the Hereafter will be greater in degrees and greater in preferment. ^qPickthall1721


Behold, how We prefer some of them over others! And surely the world to come is greater in ranks, greater in preferment. ^qArberry1721

# 22

Laa taj'al ma'al laahi ilaahan aakhara fataq'uda mazoomam makhzoolaa ^qTrans1722


DO NOT set up any other deity side by side with God, lest thou find thyself disgraced and forsaken: ^qAsad1722


Set not up with Allah any other god (O man) lest thou sit down reproved, forsaken. ^qPickthall1722


Set not up with God another god, or thou wilt sit condemned and forsaken. ^qArberry1722

Wa qadaa Rabbuka allaa ta'budooo illaaa iyyaahu wa bilwaalidaini ihsaanaa; immaa yablughanna 'indakal kibara ahaduhumaaa aw kilaahumaa falaa taqul lahumaaa uffinw wa laa tanharhumaa wa qullahumaa qawlan kareemaa ^qTrans1723


for thy Sustainer has ordained that you shall worship none but Him. And do good unto [thy] parents. Should one of them, or both, attain to old age in thy care, never say "Ugh" to them or scold them, but [always] speak unto them with reverent speech, ^qAsad1723


Thy Lord hath decreed, that ye worship none save Him, and (that ye show) kindness to parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age with thee, say not "Fie" unto them nor repulse them, but speak unto them a gracious word. ^qPickthall1723


Thy Lord has decreed you shall not serve any but Him, and to be good to parents, whether one or both of them attains old age with thee; say not to them 'Fie' neither chide them, but speak unto them words respectful, ^qArberry1723

# 24

Wakhfid lahumaa janaahaz zulli minar rahmati wa qur Rabbir hamhumaa kamaa rabbayaanee sagheera ^qTrans1724


and spread over them humbly the wings of thy tenderness, and say: "O my Sustainer! Bestow Thy grace upon them, even as they cherished and reared me when I was a child!" ^qAsad1724


And lower unto them the wing of submission through mercy, and say: My Lord! Have mercy on them both as they did care for me when I was little. ^qPickthall1724


and lower to them the wing of humbleness out of mercy and say; 'My Lord, have mercy upon them, as they raised me up when I was little.' ^qArberry1724

# 25

Rabbukum a'lamu bimaa fee nufoosikum; in takoonoo saaliheena fa innahoo kaana lil awwaabeena Ghafoooraa ^qTrans1725


Your Sustainer is fully aware of what is in your hearts. If you are righteous, [He will forgive you your errors]: for, behold, He is much-forgiving to those who turn unto Him again and again. ^qAsad1725


Your Lord is Best Aware of what is in your minds. If ye are righteous, then lo! He was ever Forgiving unto those who turn (unto Him). ^qPickthall1725

Wa aati zal qurbaa haqqahoo walmiskeena wabnas sabeeli wa laa tubazzir tabzeeraa ^qTrans1726

Innal mubazzireena kaanoo ikhwaanash shayaateeni wa kaanash shaytaanu li Rabbihee kafooraa ^qTrans1727


Behold, the squanderers are, indeed, of the ilk of the satans - inasmuch as Satan has indeed proved most ungrateful to his Sustainer. ^qAsad1727


Lo! the squanderers were ever brothers of the devils, and the devil was ever an ingrate to his Lord. ^qPickthall1727


the squanderers are brothers of Satan, and Satan is unthankful to his Lord. ^qArberry1727

# 28

Wa immaa turidanna 'anhumub tighaaa'a rahmatim mir rabbika tarjoohaa faqul lahum qawlam maisooraa ^qTrans1728


And if thou [must] turn aside from those [that are in want, because thou thyself art] seeking to obtain thy Sustainer's grace and hoping for it, at least speak unto them with gentle speech. ^qAsad1728


But if thou turn away from them, seeking mercy from thy Lord, for which thou hopest, then speak unto them a reasonable word. ^qPickthall1728


But if thou turnest from them, seeking mercy from thy Lord that thou hopest for, then speak unto them gentle words. ^qArberry1728

And neither allow thy hand to remain shackled to thy neck, nor stretch it forth to the utmost limit [of thy capacity], lest thou find thyself blamed [by thy dependants], or even destitute. ^qAsad1729


And let not thy hand be chained to thy neck nor open it with a complete opening, lest thou sit down rebuked, denuded. ^qPickthall1729


And keep not thy hand chained to thy neck, nor outspread it widespread altogether, or thou wilt sit reproached and denuded. ^qArberry1729

Inna Rabbaka yabsuturrizqa limai yashaaa'u wa yaqdir; innahoo kaana bi'ibaadihee Khabeeram Baseera ^qTrans1730


Behold, thy Sustainer grants abundant sustenance, or gives it in scant measure, unto whomever He wills: verily, fully aware is He of [the needs of] His creatures, and sees them all. ^qAsad1730


Lo! thy Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will, and straiteneth (it for whom He will). Lo, He was ever Knower, Seer of His slaves. ^qPickthall1730


Surely thy Lord outspreads and straitens His provision unto whom He will; surely He is aware of and sees His servants. ^qArberry1730

And do not take any human being's life -[the life] which God has willed to be, sacred-otherwise than in [the pursuit of] justice. Hence, if anyone has been slain wrongfully, We have empowered the defender of his rights [to exact a just retribution]; but even so, let him not exceed the bounds of equity in [retributive] killing. [And as for him who has been slain wrongfully -] behold, he is indeed succoured [by God]! ^qAsad1733


And slay not the life which Allah hath forbidden save with right. Whoso is slain wrongfully, We have given power unto his heir, but let him not commit excess in slaying. Lo! he will be helped. ^qPickthall1733


And slay not the soul God has forbidden, except by right. Whosoever is slain unjustly, We have appointed to his next-of-kin authority; but let him not exceed in slaying; he shall be helped. ^qArberry1733

And do not touch the substance of an orphan, save to improve it, before he comes of age. And be true to every promise - for, verily, [on Judgment Day] you will be called to account for every promise which you have made! ^qAsad1734


Come not near the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better till he come to strength; and keep the covenant. Lo! of the covenant it will be asked. ^qPickthall1734


And do not approach the property of the orphan save in the fairest manner, until he is of age. And fulfil the covenant; surely the covenant shall be questioned of. ^qArberry1734

# 35

Wa awful kaila izaa kiltum wa zinoo bilqistaasil mustaqeem; zaalika khairunw wa ahsanu taaweelaa ^qTrans1735


And give full measure whenever you measure, and weigh with a balance that is true: this will be [for your own] good, and best in the end. ^qAsad1735


Fill the measure when ye measure, and weigh with a right balance; that is meet, and better in the end. ^qPickthall1735

And never concern thyself with anything of which thou hast no knowledge: verily, [thy] hearing and sight and heart - all of them - will be called to account for it [on Judgment Day]! ^qAsad1736


(O man), follow not that whereof thou hast no knowledge. Lo! the hearing and the sight and the heart - of each of these it will be asked. ^qPickthall1736


And pursue not that thou hast no knowledge of; the hearing, the sight, the heart -- all of those shall be questioned of. ^qArberry1736
