Allaa ta'budooo illal laah; innanee lakum minhu nazeerunw wa basheer ^qTrans101


so that you may worship none but God. [Say, O Prophet:] "Behold, I come unto you from Him [as] a warner and a bearer of glad tidings: ^qAsad101


(Saying): Serve none but Allah. Lo! I am unto you from Him a warner and a bringer of good tidings. ^qPickthall101

Wa anis taghfiroo Rabbakum summa toobooo ilaihi yumatti'kum mataa'an hasanan ilaaa ajalim musammanw wa yu'ti kulla zee fadlin fadlahoo wa in tawallaw fa inneee akhaafu 'alaikum 'azaaba Yawmin Kabeer ^qTrans102


Ask your Sustainer to forgive you your sins, and then turn towards Him in repentance - [whereupon] He will grant you a goodly enjoyment of life [in this world] until a term set [by Him is fulfilled]; and [in the life to come] He will bestow upon everyone possessed of merit [a full reward for] his merit. But if you turn away, then, verily, I dread for you the suffering [which is bound to befall you] on that awesome Day ^qAsad102


And (bidding you): Ask pardon of your Lord and turn to Him repentant. He will cause you to enjoy a fair estate until a time appointed. He giveth His bounty unto every bountiful one. But if ye turn away, lo! (then) I fear for you the retribution of an awful Day. ^qPickthall102


and: 'Ask forgiveness of your Lord, then repent to Him, and He will give you fair enjoyment unto a term stated, and He will give of His bounty to every man of grace. But if you should turn your backs I fear for you the chastisement of a mighty day; ^qArberry102

Ilal laahi marji'ukum wa Huwa 'alaa kulli shai'in Qadeer ^qTrans103


Unto God you all must return: and He has the power to will anything." ^qAsad103


Unto Allah is your return, and He is Able to do all things. ^qPickthall103


to God shall you return; He is powerful over everything.' ^qArberry103

Alaa innahum yasnoona sudoorahum liyastakhfoo minh; alaa heena yastaghshoona siyaabahum ya'lamu maa yusiroona wa maa yu'linoon; innahoo 'aleemum bizaatis sudoor ^qTrans104


Oh, verily, they [who are bent on denying the truth of this divine writ] are enshrouding their hearts in order to hide from Him. Oh, verily, [even] when they cover themselves with their garments [in order not to see or hear], He knows all that they keep secret as well as all that they bring into the open - for, behold, He has full knowledge of what is in the hearts [of men]. ^qAsad104


Lo! now they fold up their breasts that they may hide (their thoughts) from Him. At the very moment when they cover themselves with their clothing, Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden and that which they proclaim. Lo! He is Aware of what is in the breasts (of men). ^qPickthall104


Behold, they fold their breasts, to hide them from Him; behold, when they wrap themselves in their garments He knows what they secrete and what they publish; surely He knows all the thoughts within the breasts. ^qArberry104

Wa maa min daaabbatin fil ardi illaa 'alal laahi rizquhaa wa ya'lamu mustaqarrahaa wa mustawda'ahaa; kullun fee Kitaabim Mubeen ^qTrans105


And there is no living creature on earth but depends for its sustenance on God; and He knows its time-limit [on earth] and its resting-place [after death]: all [this] is laid down in [His] clear decree. ^qAsad105


And there is not a beast in the earth but the sustenance thereof dependeth on Allah. He knoweth its habitation and its repository. All is in a clear Record. ^qPickthall105


No creature is there crawling on the earth, but its provision rests on God; He knows its lodging-place and its repository. All is in a Manifest Book. ^qArberry105

Wa Huwal lazee khalaqas samaawaati wal alrda fee sittati aiyaaminw wa kaana 'Arshuhoo alal maaa'i liyablu wakum aiyukum ahsanu 'amalaa; wa la'in qulta innakum mab'oosoona mim ba'dil mawti la yaqoolanal lazeena kafaroo in haazaaa illaa sihrum mubeen ^qTrans106


And He it is who has created the heavens and the earth in six aeons; and [ever since He has willed to create life,] the throne of His almightiness has rested upon water. [God reminds you of your dependence on Him] in order to test you [and thus to make manifest] which of you is best in conduct. For thus it is: if thou sayest [unto men], "Behold, you shall be raised again after death!" - they who are bent on denying the truth are sure to answer, "This is clearly nothing but an enchanting delusion" ^qAsad106


And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days - and His Throne was upon the water - that He might try you, which of you is best in conduct. Yet if thou (O Muhammad) sayest: Lo! ye will be raised again after death! those who disbelieve will surely say: This is naught but mere magic. ^qPickthall106


And it is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and His Throne was upon the waters -- that He might try you, which one of you is fairer in works. And if thou sayest, 'you shall surely be raised up after death,' the unbelievers will say, 'This is naught but a manifest sorcery.' ^qArberry106

Wala'in akhkharnaa 'anhumul 'azaaba ilaaa ummatim ma'doodatil la yaqoolunna maa yahbisuh; alaa yawma yaateehim laisa masroofan 'anhum wa haaqa bihim maa kaanoo bihee yastahzi'oon ^qTrans107


And thus it is: if We defer their suffering until a time-limit set [by Us], they are sure to say, "What is preventing it [from coming now]?" Oh, verily, on the Day when it befalls them there will be nothing to avert it from them; and they shall be overwhelmed by the very thing which they were wont to deride. ^qAsad107


And if We delay for them the doom until a reckoned time, they will surely say: What withholdeth it? Verily on the day when it cometh unto them, it cannot be averted from them, and that which they derided will surround them. ^qPickthall107


And if We postpone the chastisement from them till a reckoned moment they will say 'What is detaining it?' Surely, the day it shall come to them, it shall not be turned aside from them, and they shall be encompassed by that they mocked at. ^qArberry107

# 9

Wa la'in azaqnal insaana minnaa rahmatan summa naza'naahaa minhu, innahoo laya'oosun kafoor ^qTrans108


And thus it is: if We let man taste some of Our grace, and then take it away from him -behold, he abandons all hope, forgetting all gratitude [for Our past favours]. ^qAsad108


And if we cause man to taste some mercy from Us and afterward withdraw it from him, lo! he is despairing, thankless. ^qPickthall108


And if We let a man taste mercy from Us, and then We wrest it from him, he is desperate, ungrateful. ^qArberry108

Wala'in azaqnaahu na'maaa'a ba'da darraaa'a massat hu la yaqoolanna zahabas saiyiaatu 'anneee; innahoo lafarihun fakhoor ^qTrans109


And thus it is: if We let him taste ease and plenty after hardship has visited him, he is sure to say, "Gone is all affliction from me!"-for, behold, he is given to vain exultation, and glories only in himself. ^qAsad109


And if We cause him to taste grace after some misfortune that had befallen him, he saith: The ills have gone from me. Lo! he is exultant, boastful; ^qPickthall109


But if We let him taste prosperity after hardship that has visited him, he will say, 'The evils have gone from me'; behold, he is joyous, boastful -- ^qArberry109

Illal lazeena sabaroo wa 'amilus saalihaati ulaaa'ika lahum maghfiratunw wa ajrun kabeer ^qTrans1010


[And thus it is with most men-] save those who are patient in adversity and do righteous deeds: it is they whom forgiveness of sins awaits, and a great reward. ^qAsad1010


Save those who persevere and do good works. Theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward. ^qPickthall1010


save such as are patient, and do deeds of righteousness; for them awaits forgiveness and a mighty wage. ^qArberry1010

Fala'allaka taarikum ba'da maa yoohaaa ilaika wa daaa'iqum bihee sadruka ai yaqooloo law laaa unzila 'alaihi kanzun aw jaaa'a ma'ahoo malak; innamaa anta nazeer; wallaahu 'alaa kulli shai'inw wakeel ^qTrans1011


IS IT, then, conceivable [O Prophet] that thou couldst omit any part of what is being revealed unto thee [because the deniers of the truth dislike it,-and] because thy heart is distressed at their saying, "Why has not a treasure been bestowed upon him from on high?" -or, "[Why has not] an angel come [visibly:: with him?" [They fail to understand that] thou art only a warner, whereas God has everything in His care; ^qAsad1011


A likely thing, that thou wouldst forsake aught of that which hath been revealed unto thee, and that thy breast should be straitened for it, because they say: Why hath not a treasure been sent down for him, or an angel come with him? Thou art but a warner, and Allah is in charge of all things. ^qPickthall1011


Perchance thou art leaving part of what is revealed to thee, and thy breast is straitened by it, because they say, 'Why has a treasure not been sent down upon him, or an angel not come with him?' Thou art only a warner; and God is a Guardian over everything. ^qArberry1011

# 13

Am yaqooloonaf taraahu qul faatoo bi'ashri Suwarim mislihee muftarayaatinw wad'oo manis tata'tum min doonil laahi in kuntum saadiqeen ^qTrans1012


and so they assert, "[Muhammad himself] has invented this [Qur'an)!" Say [unto them]: "Produce, then, ten surahs of similar merit, invented [by yourselves], and [to this end] call to your aid whomever you can, other than, God, if what you say is true! ^qAsad1012


Or they say: He hath invented it. Say: Then bring ten surahs, the like thereof, invented, and call on everyone ye can beside Allah, if ye are truthful! ^qPickthall1012


Or do they say, 'He has forged it'? Say: 'Then bring you ten suras the like of it, forged; and call upon whom you are able, apart from God, if you speak truly.' ^qArberry1012

# 14

Fa il lam yastajeeboo lakum fa'lamooo annamaaa unzilla bi'ilmil laahi wa al laaa ilaaha illaa Huwa fahal antum muslimoon ^qTrans1013


And if they [whom you have called to your aid] are not able to help you, then know that [this Qur'an] has been bestowed from on high out of God's wisdom alone, and that there is no deity save Him. Will you, then, surrender yourselves unto Him?" ^qAsad1013


And if they answer not your prayer, then know that it is revealed only in the knowledge of Allah; and that there is no Allah save Him. Will ye then be (of) those who surrender? ^qPickthall1013


Then, if they do not answer you, know that it has been sent down with God's knowledge, and that there is no god but He. So have you surrendered? ^qArberry1013

# 15

Man kaana yureedul hayaatad dunyaa zeenatahaa nuwaffi ilaihim a'maa lahum feehaa wa hum feehaa laa yubkhasoon ^qTrans1014


AS FOR THOSE who care for [no more than] the life of this world and its bounties -We shall repay them in full for all that they did in this [life], and they, shall not be deprived of their just due therein: ^qAsad1014


Whoso desireth the life of the world and its pomp, We shall repay them their deeds herein, and therein they will not be wronged. ^qPickthall1014


Whoso desires the present life and its adornment, We will pay them in full for their works therein, and they shall not be defrauded there; ^qArberry1014

# 16

Ulaaa'ikal lazeena laisa lahum fil Aakhirati illan Naaru wa habita maa sana'oo feehaa wa baatilum maa kaanoo ya'maloon ^qTrans1015


[yet] it is they who, in the life to come, shall have nothing but the fire -for in vain shall be all that they wrought in this [world], and worthless all that they ever did! ^qAsad1015


Those are they for whom is naught in the Hereafter save the Fire. (All) that they contrive here is vain and (all) that they are wont to do is fruitless. ^qPickthall1015


those are they for whom in the world to come there is only the Fire; their deeds there will have failed, and void will be their works. ^qArberry1015

# 17

Afaman kaana 'alas baiyinatim mir Rabbihee wa yatloohu shaahidum minhu wa min qablihee Kitaabu Moosaaa imaamanw wa rahmah; ulaaa 'ika yu'minoona bih; wa mai yakfur bihee minal Ahzaabi fan Naaru maw'iduh; falaa taku fee miryatim minh; innahul haqqu mir Rabbika wa laakinna aksaran naasi laa yu'minoon ^qTrans1016


Can, then, [he who cares for no more than the life of this world be compared with] one who takes his stand on a clear evidence from his Sustainer, conveyed through [this] testimony from Him, as was the revelation vouchsafed to Moses aforetime-[a divine writ ordained by Him] to be a guidance and grace [unto man]? They [who understand this message-it is they alone who truly] believe in it; whereas for any of those who, leagued together [in common hostility], deny its truth - the fire shall be their appointed state [in the life to come]. And so, be not in doubt about this [revelation]: behold, it is the truth from thy Sustainer, even though most people will not believe in it. ^qAsad1016


Is he (to be counted equal with them) who relieth on a clear proof from his Lord, and a witness from Him reciteth it, and before it was the Book of Moses, an example and a mercy? Such believe therein, and whoso disbelieveth therein of the clans, the Fire is his appointed place. So be not thou in doubt concerning it. Lo! it is the Truth from thy Lord; but most of mankind believe not. ^qPickthall1016


And what of him who stands upon a clear sign from his Lord, and a witness from Him recites it, and before him is the Book of Moses for an ensample and a mercy? Those believe in it; but whosoever disbelieves in it, being one of the partisans, his promised land is the Fire. So be thou not in doubt of it; it is the truth from thy Lord, but most men do not believe. ^qArberry1016

# 18

Wa man azlamu mimmanif taraa 'alal laahi kazibaa; ulaaa'ika yu'radoona 'alaa Rabbihim wa yaqoolul ashhaa duhaaa'ulaaa'il lazeena kazaboo 'alaa Rabbihim; alaa la'natul laahi alaz zaalimeen ^qTrans1017


And who could be more wicked than they who attribute their own lying inventions to God? [On the Day of Judgment, such as] these shall be arraigned before their Sustainer, and those who are called upon to bear witness [against them] shall say, "It is they who uttered lies about their Sustainer!" Oh, verily, God's rejection is the due of all evildoers ^qAsad1017


Who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah? Such will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say: These are they who lied concerning their Lord. Now the curse of Allah is upon wrong-doers, ^qPickthall1017


And who does greater evil than he who forges against God a lie? Those shall be presented before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, 'Those are they who lied against their Lord.' Surely the curse of God shall rest upon the evildoers ^qArberry1017

# 19

Allazeena yasuddoona 'an sabeelil laahi wa yabghoonahaa 'iwajanw wa hum bil Aakhiratihum kaafiroon ^qTrans1018


who turn others away from the path of God and try to make it appear crooked -since it is they, they who refuse to acknowledge the truth of the life to come! ^qAsad1018


Who debar (men) from the way of Allah and would have it crooked, and who are disbelievers in the Hereafter. ^qPickthall1018


who bar from God's way, desiring to make it crooked; they disbelieve in the world to come; ^qArberry1018

# 20

Ulaaa'ika lam yakoonoo mu'jizeena fil ardi wa maa kaana lahum min doonil laahi min awliyaaa'; yudaa'afu lahumul 'azaab; maa kaanoo yastatee'oonas sam'a wa maa kaanoo yubsiroon ^qTrans1019


Never can they elude [their final reckoning, even if they remain unscathed] on earth: never will they find anyone who could protect them from God. [In the life to come] double suffering will be imposed on them for having lost the ability to hear [the truth] and having failed to see [it]. ^qAsad1019


Such will not escape in the earth, nor have they any protecting friends beside Allah. For them the torment will be double. They could not bear to hear, and they used not to see. ^qPickthall1019


they are unable to frustrate Him on earth and they have no protectors, apart from God. For them the chastisement shall be doubled; they could not hear, neither did they see. ^qArberry1019

# 21

Ulaaa'ikal lazeena khasirooo anfusahum wa dalla 'anhum maa kaanoo yaftaroon ^qTrans1020


It is they who have squandered their own selves-for [on the Day of Resurrection] all their false imagery will have forsaken them: ^qAsad1020


Such are they who have lost their souls, and that which they used to invent hath failed them. ^qPickthall1020


Those are they that have lost their souls, and that they forged has gone astray from them; ^qArberry1020

# 22

Laa jarama annahum fil Aakhirati humul akhsaroon ^qTrans1021


truly it is they, they who in the life to come shall be the losers! ^qAsad1021


Assuredly in the Hereafter they will be the greatest losers. ^qPickthall1021


they without doubt will be the greatest losers in the world to come. ^qArberry1021

# 23

Innal lazeena aamanoo wa 'amilus saalihaati wa akhbatooo ilaa Rabbihim ulaaa'ika Ashaabul Jannati hum feehaa khaalidoon ^qTrans1022


Behold, [only] those who attain to faith and do righteous deeds and humble themselves before their Sustainer - [only] they are destined for paradise, and there shall they abide. ^qAsad1022


Lo! those who believe and do good works and humble themselves before their Lord: such are rightful owners of the Garden; they will abide therein. ^qPickthall1022


But those who believe, and do righteous deeds, and have humbled themselves unto their Lord -- they shall be the inhabitants of Paradise, therein dwelling forever. ^qArberry1022

# 24

Masalul fareeqini kal a'maa wal asammi walbaseeri wassamee'; hal yastawiyaani masalaa; afalaa tazakkaroon ^qTrans1023


These two kinds of man may be likened to the blind and deaf and the seeing and hearing. Can these two be deemed alike in [their] nature? ` Will you not, then, keep this in mind? ^qAsad1023


The similitude of the two parties is as the blind and the deaf and the seer and the hearer. Are they equal in similitude? Will ye not then be admonished? ^qPickthall1023


The likeness of the two parties is as the man blind and deaf, and the man who sees and hears; are they equal in likeness? Will you not remember? ^qArberry1023

Wa laqad arsalnaa Noohan ilaa qawmihee innee lakum nazeerum mubeen ^qTrans1024


AND INDEED, [it was with the same message that] We sent forth Noah unto his people: "Behold, I come unto you with the plain warning ^qAsad1024


And We sent Noah unto his folk (and he said): Lo! I am a plain warner unto you. ^qPickthall1024


And We sent Noah to his people: 'I am for you a warner, and a bearer of good tidings: ^qArberry1024

# 26

Al laa ta'budooo illal laaha inneee akhaafu 'alaikum 'azaaba Yawmin aleem ^qTrans1025


that you may worship none but God-for, verily, I fear lest suffering befall you on a grievous Day!" ^qAsad1025


That ye serve none, save Allah. Lo! I fear for you the retribution of a painful Day. ^qPickthall1025


Serve you none but God. I fear for you the chastisement of a painful day.' ^qArberry1025

But the great ones among his people, who refused to acknowledge the truth, answered: "We do not see in thee anything but a mortal man like ourselves; and we do not see that any follow thee save those who are quite obviously the most abject among us; and we do not see that you could be in any way superior to us: on the contrary, we think that you are liars!" ^qAsad1026


The chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved, said: We see thee but a mortal like us, and we see not that any follow thee save the most abject among us, without reflection. We behold in you no merit above us - nay, we deem you liars. ^qPickthall1026


Said the Council of the unbelievers of his people, 'We see thee not other than a mortal like ourselves, and we see no? any following thee but the vilest of us, inconsiderately. We do not see you have over us any superiority; no, rather we think you are liars.' ^qArberry1026

Said [Noah]: "O my people! What do you think? If [it be true that I am taking my stand on a clear evidence from my~ Sustainer, who has vouchsafed unto me grace from Himself - [a revelation] to which you have remained blind-: [if this be true,] can we force it on you even though it be hateful to you? ^qAsad1027


He said: O my people! Bethink you, if I rely on a clear proof from my Lord and there hath come unto me a mercy from His presence, and it hath been made obscure to you, can we compel you to accept it when ye are averse thereto? ^qPickthall1027


He said, 'O my people, what think you? If I stand upon a clear sign from my Lord, and He has given me mercy from Him, and it has been obscured for you, shall we compel you to it while you are averse to it? ^qArberry1027

"And, O my people, no benefit do I ask of you for this [message]: my reward rests with none but God. And I shall not repulse [any of] those who have attained to faith. Verily, they [know that they] are destined to meet their Sustainer, whereas in you I see people without any awareness [of right and wrong]! ^qAsad1028


And O my people! I ask of you no wealth therefor. My reward is the concern only of Allah, and I am not going to thrust away those who believe - Lo! they have to meet their Lord! - but I see you a folk that are ignorant. ^qPickthall1028


O my people, I do not ask of you wealth for this; my wage falls only upon God. I will not drive away those who believe; they shall surely meet their Lord. But I see you are an ignorant people. ^qArberry1028

# 30

Wa yaa qawmi mai yansurunee minal laahi in tarattuhum; afalaa tazak karoon ^qTrans1029


And, O my people, who would shield me from God were I to repulse them? Will you not, then, keep this in mind? ^qAsad1029


And, O my people! who would deliver me from Allah if I thrust them away? Will ye not then reflect? ^qPickthall1029


O my people, who would help me against God, if I drive you away? ^qArberry1029

"And I do not say unto you, `God's treasures are with me'; nor [do I say], `I know the reality which is beyond the reach of human perception'; nor do I say, 'Behold, I am an angel'; nor do I say of those whom your eyes hold in contempt, `Never will God grant them any good'- for God is fully aware of what is in their hearts. [Were I to speak thus,] verily, I would indeed be among the evildoers." ^qAsad1030


I say not unto you: "I have the treasures of Allah" nor "I have knowledge of the Unseen," nor say I: "Lo! I am an angel!" Nor say I unto those whom your eyes scorn that Allah will not give them good - Allah knoweth best what is in their hearts - Lo! then indeed I should be of the wrong-doers. ^qPickthall1030


Will you not remember? I do not say to you, "I possess the treasuries of God"; I know not the Unseen; and I do not say, "I am an angel." Nor do I say to those your eyes despise, "God will not give them any good"; God knows best what is in their hearts. 'Surely in that case I should be among the evildoers.' ^qArberry1030

THIS ACCOUNT of the [fate of those ancient] communities - some of them still remaining, and some [extinct like] a field mown-down - We convey unto thee [as a lesson for mankind]: ^qAsad1099


That is (something) of the tidings of the townships (which were destroyed of old). We relate it unto thee (Muhammad). Some of them are standing and some (already) reaped. ^qPickthall1099

for, no wrong did We do to them, but it was they who wronged themselves. And when thy Sustainer's judgment came to pass, those deities of theirs which they had been wont to invoke instead of God proved of no avail whatever to them, and brought them no more than utter perdition. ^qAsad10100


We wronged them not, but they did wrong themselves; and their gods on whom they call beside Allah availed them naught when came thy Lord's command; they added to them naught save ruin. ^qPickthall10100


And We wronged them not, but they wronged themselves; their gods availed them not that they called upon, apart from God, anything, when the command of thy Lord came; and they increased them not, save in destruction. ^qArberry10100

Even thus is the grasp of thy Lord when He graspeth the townships while they are doing wrong. Lo! His grasp is painful, very strong. ^qPickthall10101

And as for those who will be glad (that day) they will be in the Garden, abiding there so long as the heavens and the earth endure save for that which thy Lord willeth: a gift unfailing. ^qPickthall10107

AND SO, [O Prophet,] be not in doubt about anything that those [misguided people] worship: they but [thoughtlessly] worship as their forefathers worshipped aforetime; and, behold, We shall most certainly give them their full due [for whatever good or evil they have earned], without diminishing aught thereof. ^qAsad10108

And, indeed, [similar was the case when] We vouchsafed the divine writ unto Moses, and some of his people set their own views against it; and had it not been for a decree that had already gone forth from thy Sustainer, judgment would indeed have been passed on them [then and there]: for, behold, they were in grave doubt, amounting to suspicion, about him [who called them unto God]. ^qAsad10109


And we verily gave unto Moses the Scripture, and there was strife thereupon; and had it not been for a Word that had already gone forth from thy Lord, the case would have been judged between them, and lo! they are in grave doubt concerning it. ^qPickthall10109

And incline not toward those who do wrong lest the Fire touch you, and ye have no protecting friends against Allah, and afterward ye would not be helped. ^qPickthall10112

BUT, ALAS, among those generations [whom We destroyed] before your time there were no people endowed with any virtue - [people] who would speak out against the [spread of] corruption on earth -except the few of them whom We saved [because of their righteousness], whereas those who were bent on evildoing only pursued pleasures which corrupted their whole being, and so lost themselves in sinning. ^qAsad10115


If only there had been among the generations before you men possessing a remnant (of good sense) to warn (their people) from corruption in the earth, as did a few of those whom We saved from them! The wrong-doers followed that by which they were made sapless, and were guilty. ^qPickthall10115
