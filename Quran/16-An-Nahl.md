Wa in ta'uddoo ni'matal laahi laa tuhsoohaa; innal laaha la Ghafoorur Raheem ^qTrans1618


For, should you try to count God's blessings, you could never compute them! Behold, God is indeed much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace; ^qAsad1618


And if ye would count the favour of Allah ye cannot reckon it. Lo! Allah is indeed Forgiving, Merciful. ^qPickthall1618

# 19

Wallaahu ya'lamu maa tusirroona wa maa tu'linoon ^qTrans1619


and God knows all that you keep secret as well as all that you bring into the open. ^qAsad1619


And Allah knoweth that which ye keep hidden and that which ye proclaim. ^qPickthall1619


And God knows what you keep secret and what you publish. ^qArberry1619

# 20

Wallazeena yad'oona min doonil laahi laa yakhluqoona shai'anw wa hum yukhlaqoon ^qTrans1620


Now those beings that some people invoke beside God cannot create anything, since they themselves are but created: ^qAsad1620


Those unto whom they cry beside Allah created naught, but are themselves created. ^qPickthall1620


And those they call upon, apart from God, created nothing, and themselves are created, ^qArberry1620

# 21

Amwaatun ghairu ahyaaa'inw wa maa yash'uroona aiyaana yub'asoon ^qTrans1621


they are dead, not living, and they do not [even] know when they will be raised from the dead! ^qAsad1621

# 22

Illahukum Ilaahunw Waahid; fallazeena laa yu'minoona bil Aakhirati quloobuhum munkiratunw wa hum mustakbiroon ^qTrans1622


Your God is the One God: but because of their false pride, the hearts of those who do not believe in the life to come refuse to admit this [truth]. ^qAsad1622


Your Allah is One Allah. But as for those who believe not in the Hereafter their hearts refuse to know, for they are proud. ^qPickthall1622


Your God is One God. And they who believe not in the world to come, their hearts deny, and they have waxed proud. ^qArberry1622

# 23

Laa jarama annal laaha ya'lamu maa yusirrona wa ma yu'linoon; innahoo laa yuhibbul mustakbireen ^qTrans1623


Truly, God knows all that they keep secret as well as all that they bring into the open -[and,] behold, He does not love those who are given to arrogance, ^qAsad1623


Assuredly Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden and that which they proclaim. Lo! He loveth not the proud. ^qPickthall1623


Without a doubt God knows what they keep secret and what they publish; He loves not those that wax proud. ^qArberry1623

# 24

Wa izaa qeela lahum maazaaa anzala Rabbukum qaaloo asaateerul awwaleen ^qTrans1624


and [who], whenever they are asked, "What is it that your Sustainer has bestowed from on high?"-are wont to answer, "Fables of ancient times!" ^qAsad1624


And when it is said unto them: What hath your Lord revealed? they say: (Mere) fables of the men of old, ^qPickthall1624


And when it is said to them, 'What has your Lord sent down?' they say, 'Fairy-tales of the ancients.' ^qArberry1624

Liyahmilooo awzaarahum kaamilatany Yawmal Qiyaamati wa min awzaaril lazeena yudilloonahum bighairi 'ilm; alaa saaa'a maa yaziroon ^qTrans1625


Hence, on Resurrection Day they shall bear the full weight of their own burdens, as well as some of the burdens of those ignorant ones whom they have led astray: oh, how evil the load with which they shall be burdened! ^qAsad1625


That they may bear their burdens undiminished on the Day of Resurrection, with somewhat of the burdens of those whom they mislead without knowledge. Ah! evil is that which they bear! ^qPickthall1625


That they may bear their loads complete on the Day of Resurrection, and some of the loads of those that they lead astray without any knowledge. O evil the load they bear! ^qArberry1625

# 26

Qad makaral lazeena min qablihim fa atal laahu bunyaa nahum minal qawaa'idi fakharra 'alaihimus saqfu min fawqihim wa ataahumul 'azaabu min haisu laa yash'uroon ^qTrans1626


Those who lived before them did, too, devise many a blasphemy -whereupon God visited with destruction all that they had ever built, [striking] at its very foundations, so that the roof fell in upon them from above and suffering befell them without their having perceived whence it came. ^qAsad1626


Those before them plotted, so Allah struck at the foundations of their building, and then the roof fell down upon them from above them, and the doom came on them whence they knew not; ^qPickthall1626


Those that were before them contrived; then God came upon their building from the foundations, and the roof fell down on them from over them, and the chastisement came upon them from whence they were not aware. ^qArberry1626

# 27

Summa Yawmal Qiyaamati yukhzeehim wa yaqoolu aina shurakaaa'iyal lazeena kuntum tushaaaqqoona feehim; qaalal lazeena ootul 'ilma innal khizyal Yawma wassooo'a 'alal kaafireen ^qTrans1627


And then, on Resurrection Day, He will cover them [all] with ignominy, and will say: "Where, now, are those beings to whom you ascribed a share in My divinity, [and] for whose sake you cut yourselves off [from My guidance]?" [Whereupon] those who [in their lifetime] were endowed with knowledge will say: "Verily, ignominy and misery [have fallen] this day upon those who have been denying the truth- ^qAsad1627


Then on the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them and will say: Where are My partners, for whose sake ye opposed (My guidance)? Those who have been given knowledge will say: Disgrace this day and evil are upon the disbelievers, ^qPickthall1627


Then on the Day of Resurrection He will degrade them, saying, 'Where are My associates concerning which you made a breach together?' Those that were given the knowledge will say, 'Degradation today and evil are on the unbelievers, ^qArberry1627

those whom the angels have gathered in death while they were still sinning against themselves!" Then will they [who are thus arraigned] proffer their submission, [saying:] "We did not [mean to] do any evil! [But they will be answered:] "Yea, verily, God has full knowledge of all that you were doing! ^qAsad1628


Whom the angels cause to die while they are wronging themselves. Then will they make full submission (saying): We used not to do any wrong. Nay! Surely Allah is Knower of what ye used to do. ^qPickthall1628


whom the angels take while still they are wronging themselves.' Then they will offer surrender: 'We were doing nothing evil. 'Nay; but surety God has knowledge of the things you did. ^qArberry1628

# 29

Fadkhulooo abwaaba jahannama khaalideena feeha falabi'sa maswal mutakab bireen ^qTrans1629


Hence, enter the gates of hell, therein to abide!" And evil, indeed, shall be the state of all who are given to false pride! ^qAsad1629


So enter the gates of hell, to dwell therein for ever. Woeful indeed will be the lodging of the arrogant. ^qPickthall1629


So enter the gates of Gehenna, there to dwell forever.' Evil is the lodging of those that wax proud. ^qArberry1629

Wa qeela lillazeenat taqaw maazaaa anzala Rabbukum; qaaloo khairaa; lillazeena absanoo fee haazihid dunyaa hasanah; wa la Daarul Aakhirati khair; wa lani'ma daarul muttaqeen ^qTrans1630


But [when] those who are conscious of God are asked, "What is it that your Sustainer has bestowed from on high?" -they answer, "Goodness supreme!" Good fortune awaits, in this world, all who persevere in doing good; but their ultimate state will be far better still: for, how excellent indeed will be the state of the God-conscious [in the life to come]! ^qAsad1630


And it is said unto those who ward off (evil): What hath your Lord revealed? They say: Good. For those who do good in this world there is a good (reward) and the home of the Hereafter will be better. Pleasant indeed will be the home of those who ward off (evil) - ^qPickthall1630


And it shall be said to the godfearing, 'What has your Lord sent down?' They will say, 'Good! For those who do good in this world good; and surely the abode of the world to come is better; excellent is the abode of the godfearing -- ^qArberry1630

Jannaatu 'Adniny yadkhuloonahaa tajree min tahtihal anhaaru lahum feehaa maa yashaaa'oon; kazaalika yajzil laahul muttaqeen ^qTrans1631


Gardens of perpetual bliss will they enter - [gardens] through which running waters flow - having therein all that they might desire. Thus will God reward those who are conscious of Him- ^qAsad1631


Gardens of Eden which they enter, underneath which rivers flow, wherein they have what they will. Thus Allah repayeth those who ward off (evil), ^qPickthall1631


Gardens of Eden they shall enter, underneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall have all they will. So God recompenses the godfearing, ^qArberry1631

# 32

Allazeena tatawaf faahumul malaaa'ikatu taiyibeena yaqooloona salaamun 'alai kumud khulul Jannata bimaa kuntum ta'maloon ^qTrans1632


those whom the angels gather in death while they are in a state of inner purity, greeting them thus: "Peace be upon you! Enter paradise by virtue of what you were doing [in life]!" ^qAsad1632


Those whom the angels cause to die (when they are) good. They say: Peace be unto you! Enter the Garden because of what ye used to do. ^qPickthall1632


whom the angels take while they are goodly, saying, 'Peace be on you! Enter Paradise for that you were doing.' ^qArberry1632

ARE THEY [who deny the truth] but waiting for the angels to appear unto them, or for God's judgment to become manifest? Even thus did behave those [stubborn sinners] who lived before their time; and [when they were destroyed,] it was not God who wronged them, but it was they who had wronged themselves: ^qAsad1633


Await they aught say that the angels should come unto them or thy Lord's command should come to pass? Even so did those before them. Allah wronged them not, but they did wrong themselves, ^qPickthall1633


Do they look for aught but that the angels shall come to them, or thy Lord's command shall come? So did those before them, and God wronged them not, but themselves they wronged. ^qArberry1633

# 34

Fa asaabahum saiyi aatu maa 'amiloo wa haaqa bihim maa kaano bihee yastahzi'oon ^qTrans1634


for all the evil that they had done fell [back] upon them, and they were overwhelmed by the very thing which they had been wont to deride. ^qAsad1634


So that the evils of what they did smote them, and that which they used to mock surrounded them. ^qPickthall1634


So the evil things that they wrought. smote them, and they were encompassed by that they mocked at. ^qArberry1634

# 35

Wa qaalal lazeena ashrakoo law shaaa'al laahu ma 'abadnaa min doonihee min shai'in nahnu wa laaa aabaaa'unaa wa laa harramnaa min doonihee min shai'; kazaalika fa'alal lazeena min qablihim fahal 'alar Rusuli illal balaaghul mubeen ^qTrans1635


Now they who ascribe divinity to aught beside God say, "Had God so willed, we would not have worshipped aught but Him - neither we nor our forefathers; nor would we have declared aught as forbidden without a commandment from Him." Even thus did speak those [sinners] who lived before their time; but, then, are the apostles bound to do more than clearly deliver the message [entrusted to them]? ^qAsad1635


And the idolaters say: Had Allah willed, we had not worshipped aught beside Him, we and our fathers, nor had we forbidden aught without (command from) Him. Even so did those before them. Are the messengers charged with aught save plain conveyance (of the message)? ^qPickthall1635


The idolators say, 'If God had willed we would not have served; apart from Him, anything, neither we nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden, apart from Him, anything.' So did those before them; yet is aught for the Messengers, but to deliver the manifest Message? ^qArberry1635

# 36

Wa laqad ba'asnaa fee kulli ummatir Rasoolan ani'budul laaha wajtanibut Taaghoota faminhum man hadal laahu wa minhum man haqqat 'alaihid dalaalah; faseeroo fil ardi fanzuroo kaifa kaana 'aaqibatul mukazzibeen ^qTrans1636


And indeed, within every community have We raised up an apostle [entrusted with this message]: "Worship God, and shun the powers of evil!" And among those [past generations] were people whom God graced with His guidance, just as there was among them [many a one] who inevitably fell prey to grievous error: go, then, about the earth and behold what happened in the end to those who gave the lie to the truth! ^qAsad1636


And verily We have raised in every nation a messenger, (proclaiming): Serve Allah and shun false gods. Then some of them (there were) whom Allah guided, and some of them (there were) upon whom error had just hold. Do but travel in the land and see the nature of the consequence for the deniers! ^qPickthall1636


Indeed, We sent forth among every nation a Messenger,; saying: 'Serve you God, and eschew idols.' Then some. of them God guided, and some were justly disposed to error. So journey in the land, and behold how was the end of them that cried lies. ^qArberry1636

# 37

In tahris 'alaa hudaahum fa innal laaha laa yahdee mai yudillu wa maa lahum min naasireen ^qTrans1637


[As for those who are bent on denying the truth-] though thou be ever so eager to show them the right way, [know that,] verily, God does not bestow His guidance upon any whom He judges to have gone astray; and such shall have none to succour them [on Resurrection Day]. ^qAsad1637


Even if thou (O Muhammad) desirest their right guidance, still Allah assuredly will not guide him who misleadeth. Such have no helpers. ^qPickthall1637


Though thou art ever so eager to guide them, God guides not those whom He leads astray; they have no helpers. ^qArberry1637

God propounds [to you] the parable of [two men-] a man enslaved, unable to do anything of his own accord, and a [free] man upon whom We have bestowed goodly sustenance [as a gift] from Ourselves, so that he can spend thereof [at will, both] secretly and openly. Can these [two] be deemed equal? All praise is due to God [alone]: but most of them do not understand it. ^qAsad1675


Allah coineth a similitude: (on the one hand) a (mere) chattel slave, who hath control of nothing, and (on the other hand) one on whom we have bestowed a fair provision from Us, and he spendeth thereof secretly and openly.

And Allah coineth a similitude: Two men, one of them dumb, having control of nothing, and he is a burden on his owner; whithersoever he directeth him to go, he bringeth no good. Is he equal with one who enjoineth justice and followeth a straight path (of conduct)? ^qPickthall1676

Whoso disbelieveth in Allah after his belief - save him who is forced thereto and whose heart is still content with the Faith - but whoso findeth ease in disbelief: On them is wrath from Allah. Theirs will be an awful doom. ^qPickthall16106


Whoso disbelieves in God, after he has believed -- excepting him who has been compelled, and his heart is still at rest in his belief -- but whosoever's breast is expanded in unbelief, upon them shall rest anger from God, and there awaits them a mighty chastisement; ^qArberry16106

Zaalika bi annahumus tahabbul hayaatad dunyaa 'alal Aakhirati wa annal laaha laa yahdil qawmal kaafireen ^qTrans16107


all this, because they hold this world's life in greater esteem than the life to come, and because God does not bestow His guidance upon people who deny the truth. ^qAsad16107


That is because they have chosen the life of the world rather than the Hereafter, and because Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk. ^qPickthall16107


that, because they have preferred the present life over the world to come, and that God guides not the people of the unbelievers. ^qArberry16107

And yet, behold, thy Sustainer [grants His forgiveness] unto those who forsake the domain of evil after having succumbed to its temptation, and who thenceforth strive hard [in God's cause] and are patient in adversity: behold, after such [repentance] thy Sustainer is indeed much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace! ^qAsad16110


Then lo! thy Lord - for those who became fugitives after they had been persecuted, and then fought and were steadfast - lo! thy Lord afterward is (for them) indeed Forgiving, Merciful. ^qPickthall16110

AND GOD propounds [to you] a parable: [Imagine] a town which was [once] secure and at ease, with its sustenance coming to it abundantly from all quarters, and which thereupon blasphemously refused to show gratitude for God's blessings: and therefore God caused it to taste the all-embracing misery of hunger and fear in result of all [the evil] that its people had so persistently wrought. ^qAsad16112


Allah coineth a similitude: a township that dwelt secure and well content, its provision coming to it in abundance from every side, but it disbelieved in Allah's favours, so Allah made it experience the garb of dearth and fear because of what they used to do. ^qPickthall16112


God has struck a similitude: a city that was secure, at rest, its provision coming to it easefully from every place, then it was unthankful for the blessings of God; so God let it taste the garment of hunger and of fear, for the things that they were working. ^qArberry16112

He has forbidden to you only carrion, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that over which any name other than God's has been invoked; but if one is driven [to it] by necessity - neither coveting it nor exceeding his immediate need -verily, God is much forgiving, a dispenser of grace. ^qAsad16115


He hath forbidden for you only carrion and blood and swineflesh and that which hath been immolated in the name of any other than Allah; but he who is driven thereto, neither craving nor transgressing, lo! then Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. ^qPickthall16115

Hence, do not utter falsehoods by letting your tongues determine [at your own discretion], "This is lawful and that is forbidden", thus attributing your own lying inventions to God: for, behold, they who attribute their own lying inventions to God will never attain to a happy state! ^qAsad16116
