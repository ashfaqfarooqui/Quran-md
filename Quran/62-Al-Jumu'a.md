He it is who has sent unto the unlettered people an apostle from among themselves, to convey unto them His messages, and to cause them to grow in purity, and to impart unto them the divine writ as well as wisdom - whereas before that they were indeed, most obviously, lost in error ^qAsad611

Wa aakhareena minhum lammaa yalhaqoo bihim wa huwal 'azeezul hakeem ^qTrans612


and [to cause this message to spread] from them unto other people as soon as they come into contact with them: for He alone is almighty, truly wise! ^qAsad612

Zaalika fadlul laahi yu'teehi many-yashaaa; wallaahu zul fadil 'azeem ^qTrans613


Such is God's bounty: He grants it to anyone who is willing [to receive it]: for God is limitless in His great bounty. ^qAsad613


That is the bounty of Allah; which He giveth unto whom He will. Allah is of Infinite Bounty. ^qPickthall613


That is the bounty of God; He gives it to whom He will, and God is of bounty abounding. ^qArberry613

Masalul lazeena hum milut tawraata summa lam yahmiloonhaa kamasalil himaari yah milu asfaaraa; bi'sa masalul qawmil lazeena kaazzaboo bi aayaatil laah; wallaahu laa yahdil qawmazzaalimeen ^qTrans614


THE PARABLE of those who were graced with the burden of the Torah, and thereafter failed to bear this burden, is that of an ass that carries a load of books [but cannot benefit from them]. Calamitous is the parable of people who are bent on giving the lie to God's messages - for God does not bestow His guidance upon such evildoing folk! ^qAsad614


The likeness of those who are entrusted with the Law of Moses, yet apply it not, is as the likeness of the ass carrying books. Wretched is the likeness of folk who deny the revelations of Allah. And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk. ^qPickthall614


The likeness of those who have been loaded with the Torah then they have not carried it, is as the likeness of an ass carrying books. Evil is the likeness of the people who have cried lies to God's signs. God guides never the people of the evildoers. ^qArberry614

Qul yaaa ayyuhal lazeena haadoo in za'amtum annakum awliyaaa'u lilaahi min doonin naasi fatamannawul mawta in kuntum saadiqeen ^qTrans615


Say: "O you who follow the Jewish faith! If you claim that you [alone] are close to God, to the exclusion of all other people, then you should be longing for death - if what you say is true!" ^qAsad615


Say (O Muhammad): O ye who are Jews! If ye claim that ye are favoured of Allah apart from (all) mankind, then long for death if ye are truthful. ^qPickthall615


Say: 'You of Jewry, if you assert that you are the friends of God, apart from other men, then do you long for death, if you speak truly.' ^qArberry615

# 7

Wa laa yatamannaw nahooo abadam bimaa qaddamat aydeehim; wallaahu 'aleemum bix zaalimeen ^qTrans616


But never will they long for it, because [they are aware] of what their hands have wrought in this world; and God has full knowledge of evildoers. ^qAsad616


But they will never long for it because of all that their own hands have sent before, and Allah is Aware of evil-doers. ^qPickthall616

Qul innal mawtal lazee tafirroona minhu fa innahoo mulaaqeekum summa turaddoona ilaa 'Aalimil Ghaibi wash shahaadati fa yunabbi'ukum bimaa kuntum ta'maloon ^qTrans617


Say: "Behold, the death from which you are fleeing is bound to overtake you - and then you will be brought back unto Him who knows all that is beyond the reach of a created being's perception as well as all that can be witnessed by a creature's senses or mind, whereupon He will make you truly understand all that you were doing [in life]. ^qAsad617


Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Lo! the death from which ye shrink will surely meet you, and afterward ye will be returned unto the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, and He will tell you what ye used to do. ^qPickthall617


Say: 'Surely death, from which you flee, shall encounter you; then you shall be returned to the Knower of the Unseen and the Visible, and He will tell you that you have been doing.' ^qArberry617

Yaaa ayyuhal lazeena aamanoo izaa noodiya lis-Salaati miny yawmil Jumu'ati fas'aw ilaa zikril laahi wa zarul bai'; zaalikum khayrul lakum in kuntum ta'lamoon ^qTrans618


O YOU who have attained to faith! When the call to prayer is sounded on the day of congregation, hasten to the remembrance of God, and leave all worldly commerce: this is for your own good, if you but knew it. ^qAsad618


O ye who believe! When the call is heard for the prayer of the day of congregation, haste unto remembrance of Allah and leave your trading. That is better for you if ye did but know. ^qPickthall618

Fa-izaa qudiyatis Salaatu fantashiroo fil ardi wabtaghoo min fadlil laahi wazkurul laaha kaseeral la'allakum tuflihoon ^qTrans619


And when the prayer is ended, disperse freely on earth and seek to obtain [something] of God's bounty; but remember God often, so that you might attain to a happy state! ^qAsad619


And when the prayer is ended, then disperse in the land and seek of Allah's bounty, and remember Allah much, that ye may be successful. ^qPickthall619

Wa izaa ra'aw tijaaratan aw lahwanin faddooo ilaihaa wa tarakooka qaaa'imaa; qul maa 'indal laahi khairum minal lahwi wa minat tijaarah; wallaahu khayrur raaziqeen ^qTrans6110


Yet [it does happen that] when people become aware of [an occasion for] worldly gain or a passing delight, they rush headlong towards it, and leave thee standing [and preaching]. Say: "That which is with God is far better than all passing delight and all gain! And God is the best of providers!" ^qAsad6110


But when they spy some merchandise or pastime they break away to it and leave thee standing. Say: That which Allah hath is better than pastime and than merchandise, and Allah is the Best of providers. ^qPickthall6110


But when they see merchandise or diversion they scatter off to it, and they leave thee standing. Say: 'What is with God is better than diversion and merchandise. God is the best of providers.' ^qArberry6110
