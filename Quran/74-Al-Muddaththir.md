For We have caused none but angelic powers to lord over the fire [of hell]; and We have not caused their number to be aught but a trial for those who are bent on denying the truth - to the end that they who have been granted revelation aforetime might be convinced [of the truth of this divine writ]; and that they who have attained to faith [in it] might grow yet more firm in their faith; and that [both] they who have been granted the earlier revelation and they who believe [in this one] might be freed of all doubt; and that they in whose hearts is disease and the who deny the truth outright might ask, "What does [your] God mean by this parable?" In this way God lets go astray him that wills [to go astray], and guides aright him that wills [to be guided]. And none can comprehend thy Sustainers forces save Him alone: and all this is but a reminder to mortal man. ^qAsad7330


We have appointed only angels to be wardens of the Fire, and their number have We made to be a stumbling-block for those who disbelieve; that those to whom the Scripture hath been given may have certainty, and that believers may increase in faith; and that those to whom the Scripture hath been given and believers may not doubt; and that those in whose hearts there is disease, and disbelievers, may say: What meaneth Allah by this similitude? Thus Allah sendeth astray whom He will, and whom He will He guideth. None knoweth the hosts of thy Lord save Him. This is naught else than a Reminder unto mortals. ^qPickthall7330


We have appointed only angels to be masters of the Fire, and their number We have appointed only as a trial for the unbelievers, that those who were given the Book may have certainty, and that those who believe may increase in belief, and that those who were given the Book and those who believe may not be in-doubt, and that those in whose hearts there is sickness, and the unbelievers, may say, 'What did God intend by this as a similitude?' So God leads astray whomsoever He will, and He guides whomsoever He will; and none knows the hosts of thy Lord but He. And it is naught but a Reminder to mortals. ^qArberry7330

Famaa tanfa'uhum shafaa'atush shaafi'een ^qTrans7347


And so, of no benefit to them could be the intercession of any that would intercede for them. ^qAsad7347


The mediation of no mediators will avail them then. ^qPickthall7347

Yea, everyone of them claims that he [himself] ought to have been given revelations unfolded! ^qAsad7351


Nay, but everyone of them desireth that he should be given open pages (from Allah). ^qPickthall7351


Nay, every man of them desires to be -- given -- scrolls unrolled. ^qArberry7351

Fa man shaaa'a zakarah ^qTrans7354

Wa maa yazkuroona illaaa any yashaaa'al laah; Huwa ahlut taqwaa wa ahlul maghfirah ^qTrans7355


But they [who do not believe in the life to come] will not take it to heart unless God so wills: [for] He is the Fount of all God-consciousness, and the Fount of all forgiveness. ^qAsad7355


And they will not heed unless Allah willeth (it). He is the fount of fear. He is the fount of Mercy. ^qPickthall7355


And they will not remember, except that God wills; He is worthy to be feared, -- worthy to forgive. ^qArberry7355
