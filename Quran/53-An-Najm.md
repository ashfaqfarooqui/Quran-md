These [allegedly divine beings] are nothing but empty names which you have invented - you and your forefathers - [and] for which God has bestowed no warrant from on high.

Falillaahil aakhiratu wal oolaa ^qTrans5325


despite the fact that [both] the life to come and this present [one] belong to God [alone]? ^qAsad5325


But unto Allah belongeth the after (life), and the former. ^qPickthall5325


And to God belongs the First and the Last. ^qArberry5325

# 26

Wa kam mim malakin fissamaawaati laa tughnee shafaa'atuhum shai'an illaa mim ba'di anyyaazanal laahu limany yashaaa'u wa yardaa ^qTrans5326


For, however many angels there be in the heavens, their intercession can be of no least avail [to anyone] - except after God has given leave [to inter­cede] for whomever He wills and with whom He is well-pleased. ^qAsad5326


And how many angels are in the heavens whose intercession availeth naught save after Allah giveth leave to whom He chooseth and accepteth. ^qPickthall5326

Wa maa lahum bihee min 'ilmin iny yattabi'oona illaz zanna wa innaz zanna laa yughnee minal haqqi shai'aa ^qTrans5328


and [since] they have no knowledge whatever thereof, they follow nothing but surmise: yet, behold, never can surmise take the place of truth. ^qAsad5328


And they have no knowledge thereof. They follow but a guess, and lo! a guess can never take the place of the truth. ^qPickthall5328


They have not any knowledge thereof; they follow only surmise, and surmise avails naught against truth. ^qArberry5328

# 29

Fa a'rid 'am man tawallaa 'an zikrinaa wa lam yurid illal hayaatad dunyaa ^qTrans5329


Avoid thou, therefore, those who turn away from all remembrance of Us and care for no more than the life of this world, ^qAsad5329


Then withdraw (O Muhammad) from him who fleeth from Our remembrance and desireth but the life of the world. ^qPickthall5329


So turn thou from him who turns away from Our Remembrance, and desires only the present life. ^qArberry5329

# 30

Zalika mablaghuhum minal 'ilm; inna rabbaka huwa a'lamu biman dalla 'an sabee lihee wa huwa a'lamu bimanih tadaa ^qTrans5330


which, to them, is the only thing worth knowing. Behold, thy Sustainer is fully aware as to who has strayed from His path, and fully aware is He as to who follows His guidance. ^qAsad5330


Such is their sum of knowledge. Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who strayeth, and He is Best Aware of him whom goeth right. ^qPickthall5330


That is their attainment of knowledge. Surely thy Lord knows very well those who have gone astray from His way, and He knows very well those who are guided. ^qArberry5330

# 31

Wa lillaahi maa fis samaawaati wa maa fil ardi liyajziyal lazeena asaaa'oo bimaa 'amiloo wa yajziyal lazeena ahsanoo bilhusnaa ^qTrans5331


Indeed, unto God belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth: and so He will reward those who do evil in accordance with what they did, and will reward those who do good with ultimate good. ^qAsad5331


And unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, that He may reward those who do evil with that which they have done, and reward those who do good with goodness. ^qPickthall5331


To God belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, that He may recompense those who do evil for what they have done, and recompense those who have done good with the reward most fair. ^qArberry5331

# 32

Allazeena yajtaniboona kabaaa'iral ismi walfawaa hisha illal lamam; inna rabbaka waasi'ul maghfirah; huwa a'lamu bikum iz ansha akum minal ardi wa iz antum ajinnatun fee butooni umma haatikum falaa tuzakkooo anfusakum huwa a'lamu bimanit taqaa ^qTrans5332


As for those who avoid the [truly] grave sins and shameful deeds - even though they may some­times stumble behold, thy Sustainer is abounding in forgiveness. He is fully aware of you when He brings you into being out of dust, and when you are still hidden in your mothers’ wombs: do not, then, consider your­selves pure - [for] He knows best as to who is conscious of Him. ^qAsad5332


Those who avoid enormities of sin and abominations, save the unwilled offences - (for them) lo! thy Lord is of vast mercy. He is Best Aware of you (from the time) when He created you from the earth, and when ye were hidden in the bellies of your mothers. Therefor ascribe not purity unto yourselves. He is Best Aware of him who wardeth off (evil). ^qPickthall5332


Those who avoid the heinous sins and indecencies, save lesser offences surely thy Lord is wide in His forgiveness. Very well He knows you, when He produced you from the earth, and when you were yet unborn in your mothers' wombs; therefore hold not yourselves purified; God knows very well him who is godfearing. ^qArberry5332

# 33

Afara'ayatal lazee tawallaa ^qTrans5333


HAST THOU, then, ever considered him who turns away [from remembering Us, and cares for no more than the life of this world], ^qAsad5333


Didst thou (O Muhammad) observe him who turned away, ^qPickthall5333


Hast thou considered him who turns his back ^qArberry5333

# 34
