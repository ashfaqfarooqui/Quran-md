Alhamdu lillaahil lazee khalaqas samaawaati wal arda wa ja'alaz zulumaati wannoor; summal lazeena kafaroo bi Rabbihim ya'diloon ^qTrans61


ALL PRAISE is due to God, who has created the heavens and the earth, and brought into being deep darkness as well as light: and yet, those who are bent on denying the truth regard other powers as their Sustainer's equals! ^qAsad61


Praise be to Allah, Who hath created the heavens and the earth, and hath appointed darkness and light. Yet those who disbelieve ascribe rivals unto their Lord. ^qPickthall61


Praise belongs to God who created the heavens and the earth and appointed the shadows and light; then the unbelievers ascribe equals to their Lord. ^qArberry61

Huwal lazee khalaqakum min teenin summa qadaaa ajalanw wa ajalum musamman 'indahoo summa antum tamtaroon ^qTrans62


He it is who has created you out of clay, and then has decreed a term [for you] - a term known [only] to him. And yet you doubt – ^qAsad62

Wa Huwal laahu fissamaawaati wa fil ardi ya'lamu sirrakum wa jahrakum wa ya'lamu maa taksiboon ^qTrans63


although He is God in the heavens and on earth, knowing all that you keep secret as well as all that you do openly, and knowing what you deserve. ^qAsad63


He is Allah in the heavens and in the earth. He knoweth both your secret and your utterance, and He knoweth what ye earn. ^qPickthall63


He is God in the heavens and the earth; He knows your secrets, and what you publish, and He knows what you are earning. ^qArberry63

# 4

Wa maa taateehim min Aayatim min Aayaati Rabbihim illaa kaanoo 'anhaa mu'rideen ^qTrans64


Yet whenever any of their Sustainer's messages comes unto them, they [who are bent on denying the truth] turn their backs upon it: ^qAsad64


Never came there unto them a revelation of the revelations of Allah but they did turn away from it. ^qPickthall64


Not a sign of their Lord comes to them, but they turn away from it. ^qArberry64

# 5

Faqad kazzaboo bilhaqqi lammaa jaaa'ahum fasawfa yaateehim ambaaa'u maa kaanoo bihee yastahzi'oon ^qTrans65


and so they give the lie to this truth now that it has come unto them. In time, however, they will come to understand what it was that they were wont to deride. ^qAsad65


And they denied the truth when it came unto them. But there will come unto them the tidings of that which they used to deride. ^qPickthall65


They cried lies to the truth when it came to them, but there shall come to them news of that they were mocking. ^qArberry65

Do they not see how many a generation We have destroyed before their time - [people] whom We had given a [bountiful] place on earth, the like of which We never gave unto you, and upon whom We showered heavenly blessings abundant, and at whose feet We made running waters flow? And yet we destroyed them for their sins, and gave rise to other people in their stead. ^qAsad66


See they not how many a generation We destroyed before them, whom We had established in the earth more firmly than We have established you, and We shed on them abundant showers from the sky, and made the rivers flow beneath them. Yet we destroyed them for their sins, and created after them another generation. ^qPickthall66


Have they not regarded how We destroyed before them many a generation We established in the earth, as We never established you, and how We loosed heaven upon them in torrents, and made the rivers to flow beneath them? Then We destroyed them because of their sins, and raised up after them another generation; ^qArberry66

Wa law nazzalnaa 'alaika Kitaaban fee qirtaasin falamasoohu bi aideehim laqaalal lazeena kafarooo in haazaaa illaa sihrum mubeen ^qTrans67


But even if we had sent down unto thee [O Prophet] a writing on paper, and they had touched it with their own hands - those who are bent on denying the truth would indeed have said, "This is clearly nothing but a deception!" ^qAsad67


Had we sent down unto thee (Muhammad) (actual) writing upon parchment, so that they could feel it with their hands, those who disbelieve would have said: This is naught else than mere magic. ^qPickthall67


Had We sent down on thee a Book on parchment and so they touched it with their hands, yet the unbelievers would have said, 'This is naught but manifest sorcery.' ^qArberry67

# 8

Wa qaaloo law laaa unzila alaihi malakunw wa law anzalna malakal laqudiyal amru summa laa yunzaroon ^qTrans68


They are saying, too, "Why has not an angel (visibly] been sent down unto him?" But had we sent down an angel, all would indeed have been decided, and they would have been allowed no further respite [for repentance. ^qAsad68


They say: Why hath not an angel been sent down unto him? If We sent down an angel, then the matter would be judged; no further time would be allowed them (for reflection). ^qPickthall68


'Why has an angel not been sent down on him?' they say; yet had We sent down an angel, the matter would have been determined, and then no respite would be given them. ^qArberry68

# 9

Wa law ja'alnaahu malakal laja'alnaahu rajulanw wa lalabasnaa 'alaihim maa yalbisoon ^qTrans69


And (even] if We had appointed an angel as Our message-bearer, We would certainly have made him [appear as] a man - and thus We would only have confused them in the same way as they are now confusing themselves. ^qAsad69


Had we appointed him (Our messenger) an angel, We assuredly had made him (as) a man (that he might speak to men); and (thus) obscured for them (the truth) they (now) obscure. ^qPickthall69


And had We made him an angel, yet assuredly We would have made him a man, and confused for them the thing which they themselves are confusing. ^qArberry69

# 10

Wa laqadis tuhzi'a bi-Rusulim min qablika fahaaqa billazeena sakhiroo minhum maa kaanoo bihee yastahzi'oon ^qTrans610


And, indeed, [even] before thy time have apostles been derided - but those who scoffed at them were [in the end] overwhelmed by the very thing which they were wont to deride. ^qAsad610


Messengers (of Allah) have been derided before thee, but that whereat they scoffed surrounded such of them as did deride. ^qPickthall610


Messengers indeed were mocked at before thee; but those that scoffed at them were encompassed by that they mocked at. ^qArberry610

Qul seeroo fil ardi summan zuroo kaifa kaana 'aaqibatul mukazzibeen ^qTrans611

Say: "Unto whom belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth?" Say: "Unto God, who has willed upon Himself the law of grace and mercy.

Say: Unto whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth? Say: Unto Allah. He hath prescribed for Himself mercy, that He may bring you all together to the Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt. Those who ruin their souls will not believe. ^qPickthall612

# 13

Wa lahoo maa sakana fillaili wannahaar; wa Huwas Samee'ul Aleem ^qTrans613


although His is all that dwells in the night and the day, and He alone is all-hearing, all-knowing. ^qAsad613


Unto Him belongeth whatsoever resteth in the night and the day. He is the Hearer, the Knower. ^qPickthall613

Say: "Am I to take for my master anyone but God, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, when it is He who gives nourishment and Himself needs none?” Say: "I am bidden to be foremost among those who surrender themselves unto God, and not to be among those who ascribe divinity to aught beside Him." ^qAsad614


Say: Shall I choose for a protecting friend other than Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who feedeth and is never fed? Say: I am ordered to be the first to surrender (unto Him). And be not thou (O Muhammad) of the idolaters. ^qPickthall614


Say: 'Shall I take to myself as protector other than God, the Originator of the heavens and of the earth, He. who feeds and is not fed?' Say: 'I have been commanded to be the first of them that surrender: "Be not thou of the idolaters."' ^qArberry614

# 15

Qul inneee akhaafu in 'asaitu Rabbee 'azaaba Yawmin 'Azeem ^qTrans615


Say: "Behold, I would dread, were I [thus] to rebel against my Sustainer, the suffering [which would befall me] on that awesome Day [of Judgment]." ^qAsad615


Say: I fear, if I rebel against my Lord, the retribution of an Awful Day. ^qPickthall615


Say: 'Indeed I fear, if I should rebel against thy Lord, the chastisement of a dreadful day.' ^qArberry615

# 16

Mai yusraf 'anhu Yawma'izin faqad rahimah; wa zaalikal fawzul mubeen ^qTrans616


Upon him who shall be spared on that Day, He will indeed have bestowed His grace: and this will be a manifest triumph. ^qAsad616


He from whom (such retribution) is averted on that day, (Allah) hath in truth had mercy on him. That will be the signal triumph. ^qPickthall616


From whomsoever it is averted on that day, He will have mercy on him; that is the manifest triumph. ^qArberry616

# 17

Wa iny-yamsaskal laahu bidurrin falaaa kaashifa lahoo illaa Huwa wa iny-yamsaska bikhairin fa Huwa 'alaa kulli shai'in Qadeer ^qTrans617


And if God should touch thee with misfortune, there is none who could remove it but He; and if He should touch thee with good fortune -it is He who has the power to will anything: ^qAsad617


If Allah touch thee with affliction, there is none that can relieve therefrom save Him, and if He touch thee with good fortune (there is none that can impair it); for He is Able to do all things. ^qPickthall617


And if God visits thee with affliction none can remove it but He; and if He visits thee with good, He is powerful over everything. ^qArberry617

# 18

Wa Huwal gaahiru fawqa 'ibaadih; wa Huwal Hakeemul Khabeer ^qTrans618


for He alone holds sway over His creatures, and He alone is truly wise, all-aware. ^qAsad618


He is the Omnipotent over His slaves, and He is the Wise, the Knower. ^qPickthall618

Qul ayyu shai'in akbaru shahaadatan qulil laahu shaheedum bainee wa bainakum; wa oohiya ilaiya haazal Qur'aanu li unzirakum bihee wa mam balagh; a'innakum latashhadoona anna ma'al laahi aalihatan ukhraa; qul laaa ashhad; qul innamaa Huwa Ilaahunw Waahidunw wa innanee baree'um mimmaa tushrikoon ^qTrans619


Say: "What could most weightily bear witness to the truth?" Say: "God is witness between me and you; and this Qur’an has been revealed unto me so that on the strength thereof I might warn you and all whom it may reach." Could you in truth bear witness that there are other deities side by side with God? Say: "I bear no [such] witness!" Say: "He is the One God; and, behold, far be it from me to ascribe divinity, as, you do, to aught beside Him!" ^qAsad619


Say (O Muhammad): What thing is of most weight in testimony? Say: Allah is Witness between me and you. And this Qur'an hath been inspired in me, that I may warn therewith you and whomsoever it may reach. Do ye in sooth bear witness that there are gods beside Allah? Say: I bear no such witness. Say: He is only One Allah. Lo! I am innocent of that which ye associate (with Him). ^qPickthall619


Say: 'God is witness between me and you, and this Koran has been revealed to me that I may warn you thereby, and whomsoever it may reach. Do you indeed testify that there are other gods with God?' Say: 'I do not testify.' Say: 'He is only One God, and I am quit of that you associate.' ^qArberry619

Allazeena aatainaa humul Kitaaba ya'rifoonahoo kamaa ya'rifoona abnaaa'ahum; allazeena khasirooo anfusahum fahum laa yu'minoon ^qTrans620


They unto whom we have vouchsafed revelation aforetime know this as they know their own children; yet those [of them] who have squandered their own selves -it is they who refuse to believe. ^qAsad620


Those unto whom We gave the Scripture recognise (this revelation) as they recognise their sons. Those who ruin their own souls will not believe. ^qPickthall620

Wa man azlamu mim manif tara 'alal laahi kaziban aw kazzaba bi Aayaatih; innahoo laa yuflihuz zaalimoon ^qTrans621


And who could be more wicked than he who attributes his own lying inventions to God or gives the lie to His messages? Verily, such evildoers will never attain to a happy state: ^qAsad621


Who doth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie against Allah or denieth His revelations? Lo! the wrongdoers will not be successful. ^qPickthall621


And who does greater evil than he who forges against God a lie, or cries lies to His signs? They shall not prosper, the evildoers. ^qArberry621

# 22

Wa yawma nahshuruhum jamee'an summa naqoolu lillazeena ashrakooo ayna shurakaaa' ukumul lazeena kuntum taz'umoon ^qTrans622


for one Day We shall gather them all together, and then We shall say unto those who ascribed divinity to aught beside God: "Where, now, are those beings whom you imagined to have a share in God's divinity?" ^qAsad622


And on the day We gather them together We shall say unto those who ascribed partners (unto Allah): Where are (now) those partners of your make-believe? ^qPickthall622


And on the day when We shall muster them all together, then We shall say unto those who associated other gods with God, 'Where are your associates whom you were asserting? ^qArberry622

# 23

Summa lam takun fitnatuhum illaaa an qaaloo wallaahi Rabbinaa maa kunnaa mushrikeen ^qTrans623


Whereupon, in their utter confusion, they will only [be able to] say: "By God, our Sustainer, we did not [mean to] ascribe divinity to aught beside Him!" ^qAsad623


Then will they have no contention save that they will say: By Allah, our Lord, we never were idolaters. ^qPickthall623


Then they shall have no proving, but to say, 'By God our Lord, we never associated other gods with Thee.' ^qArberry623

# 24

Unzur kaifa kazaboo 'alaaa anfusihim, wa dalla 'anhum maa kaanoo yaftaroon ^qTrans624


Behold how they have lied to themselves -and [how] their false imagery has forsaken them! ^qAsad624


See how they lie against themselves, and (how) the thing which they devised hath failed them! ^qPickthall624


Behold how they lie against themselves, and how that which they were forging has gone astray from them! ^qArberry624

Wa minhum mai yastami'u ilaika wa ja'alnaa 'alaa quloobihim akinnatan ai yafqahoohu wa feee aazaanihim waqraa; wa ai yaraw kulla Aayatil laa yu'minoo bihaa; hattaaa izaa jaaa'oka yujaadiloonaka yaqoolul lazeena kafaroo in haazaa illaaa asaateerul awwaleen ^qTrans625


And there are among them such as [seem to] listen to thee [O Prophet]: but over their hearts We have laid veils which prevent them from grasping the truth, and into their ears, deafness. And were they to see every sign [of the truth], they would still not believe in it-so much so that when they come unto thee to contend with thee, those who are bent on denying the truth say, "This is nothing but fables of ancient times!" ^qAsad625


Of them are some who listen unto thee, but We have placed upon their hearts veils, lest they should understand, and in their ears a deafness. If they saw every token they would not believe therein; to the point that, when they come unto thee to argue with thee, the disbelievers say: This is naught else than fables of the men of old. ^qPickthall625


And some of them there are that listen to thee, and We lay veils upon their hearts lest they understand it, and in their ears heaviness; and if they see any sign whatever, they do not believe in it, so that when they come to thee they dispute with thee, the unbelievers saying, 'This is naught but the fairy-tales of the ancient ones.' ^qArberry625

# 26

Wa hum yanhawna 'anhu wa yan'awna 'anhu wa iny yuhlikoona illaa anfusahum wa maa yash'uroon ^qTrans626


And they bar others therefrom. and go far away from it: but they destroy none but themselves, and perceive it not. ^qAsad626


And they forbid (men) from it and avoid it, and they ruin none save themselves, though they perceive not. ^qPickthall626


And they forbid it, and keep afar from it, and it is only themselves they destroy, but they are not aware. ^qArberry626

# 27

Wa law taraaa iz wauqifoo 'alan Naari faqaaloo yaa laitanaa nuraddu wa laa nukaz ziba bi Aayaati Rabbinaa wa nakoona minal mu'mineen ^qTrans627


If thou couldst but see [them] when they will be made to stand before the fire and will say, "Oh, would that we were brought back [to life]: then we would not give the lie to our Sustainer's messages, but would be among the believers!" ^qAsad627


If thou couldst see when they are set before the Fire and say: Oh, would that we might return! Then would we not deny the revelations of our Lord but we would be of the believers! ^qPickthall627


If thou couldst see when they are stationed before the Fire, and they say, 'Would that we might be returned, and then not cry lies to the signs of our Lord, but that we might be among the believers!' ^qArberry627

# 28

Bal badaa lahum maa kaanoo yukhfoona min qablu wa law ruddoo la'aadoo limaa nuhoo 'anhu wa innahum lakaaziboon ^qTrans628


But nay -[they will say this only because] the truth which they used to conceal [from themselves] in the past will have become obvious to them; and if they were brought back [to life], they would return to the very thing which was forbidden to them: for behold, they are indeed liars! ^qAsad628


Nay, but that hath become clear unto them which before they used to hide. And if they were sent back they would return unto that which they are forbidden. Lo! they are liars. ^qPickthall628


No; that which they were concealing before has now appeared to them; and even if they were returned, they would again commit the very thing they were prohibited; they are truly liars. ^qArberry628

# 29

Wa qaalooo in hiya illaa hayaatunad dunyaa wa maa nahnu bimab'ooseen ^qTrans629


And some [of the unbelievers] say, "There is nothing beyond our life in this world, for We shall not be raised from the dead." ^qAsad629


And they say: There is naught save our life of the world, and we shall not be raised (again). ^qPickthall629


And they say, 'There is only our present life; we shall not be raised.' ^qArberry629

Wa law taraa iz wuqifoo 'alaa Rabbihim; qaala alaisa haazaa bilhaqq; qaaloo balaa wa Rabbinaa; qaala fazooqul 'azaaba bimaa kuntum takfuroon ^qTrans630


If thou couldst but see [them] when they shall be made to stand before their Sustainer [and] He will say, "Is not this the truth?" They will answer: "Yea, indeed, by our Sustainer!" [Whereupon] He will say: "Taste, then, the suffering that comes from your having refused to acknowledge the truth!" ^qAsad630


If thou couldst see when they are set before their Lord! He will say: Is not this real? They will say: Yea, verily, by our Lord! He will say: Taste now the retribution for that ye used to disbelieve. ^qPickthall630


If thou couldst see when they are stationed before their Lord! He will say, 'Is not this the truth?' They will say, 'Yes indeed, by our Lord!' He will say, 'Then taste the chastisement for your unbelief. ^qArberry630

Lost indeed are they who consider it a lie that they will have to meet God -till the Last Hour suddenly comes upon them, [and] they cry, "Alas for us, that we disregarded it!" - for they shall bear on their backs the burden of their sins: oh, how evil the load with which they shall be burdened! ^qAsad631


They indeed are losers who deny their meeting with Allah until, when the Hour cometh on them suddenly, they cry: Alas for us, that we neglected it! They bear upon their backs their burdens. Ah, evil is that which they bear! ^qPickthall631


Lost indeed are they that cried lies to the encounter with God, so that when the Hour comes to them suddenly they shall say, 'Alas for us, that we neglected it!' On their backs they shall be bearing their loads; O how evil the loads they bear! ^qArberry631

# 32

Wa mal hayaatud dunyaaa illaa la'ibunw wa lahwunw wa lad Daarul Aakhiratu kahyrul lillazeena yattaqoon; afalaa ta'qiloon ^qTrans632


And nothing is the life of this world but a play and a passing delight; and the life in the hereafter is by far the better for all who are conscious of God. Will you not, then, use your reason? ^qAsad632


Naught is the life of the world save a pastime and a sport. Better far is the abode of the Hereafter for those who keep their duty (to Allah). Have ye then no sense? ^qPickthall632


The present life is naught but a sport and a diversion; surely the Last Abode is better for those that are godfearing. What, do you not understand? ^qArberry632

# 33

Qad na'lamu innahoo layahzunukal lazee yaqooloona fa innahum laa yukazziboonaka wa laakinnaz zaalimeena bi Aayaatil laahi yajhadoon ^qTrans633


Well do We know that what such people say grieves thee indeed: yet, behold, it is not thee to whom they give the lie, but God's messages do these evildoers deny. ^qAsad633


We know well how their talk grieveth thee, though in truth they deny not thee (Muhammad) but evil-doers flout the revelations of Allah. ^qPickthall633


We know indeed that it grieves thee the things they say; yet it is not thee they cry lies to, but the evildoers - it is the signs of God that they deny. ^qArberry633

Wa laqad kuzzibat Rusulum min qablika fasabaroo 'alaa maa kuzziboo wa oozoo hattaaa ataahum nasrunaa; wa laa mubaddila li Kalimaatil laah; wa laqad jaaa'aka min naba'il mursaleen ^qTrans634


And, indeed, [even] before thy time have apostles been given the lie, and they endured with patience all those charges of falsehood, and all the hurt done to them, till succour came unto them from Us: for there is no power that could alter [the outcome of] God's promises. And some of the histories of those apostles have already come within thy ken. ^qAsad634


Messengers indeed have been denied before thee, and they were patient under the denial and the persecution till Our succour reached them. There is none to alter the decisions of Allah. Already there hath reached thee (somewhat) of the tidings of the messengers (We sent before). ^qPickthall634


Messengers indeed were cried lies to before thee, yet they endured patiently that they were cried lies to, and were hurt, until Our help came unto them. No man can change the words of God; and there has already come to thee some tiding of the Envoys. ^qArberry634

And if it distress thee that those who deny the truth turn their backs on thee - why, then, if thou art able to go down deep into the earth or to ascend a ladder unto heaven in order to bring them a [yet more convincing] message, [do so;] but [remember that] had God so willed, He would indeed have gathered them all unto [His] guidance. Do not, therefore, allow thyself to ignore [God's ways]. ^qAsad635


And if their aversion is grievous unto thee, then, if thou canst, seek a way down into the earth or a ladder unto the sky that thou mayst bring unto them a portent (to convince them all)! - If Allah willed, He could have brought them all together to the guidance - So be not thou among the foolish ones. ^qPickthall635

We did enjoy one another's fellowship [in life]; but (now that] we have reached the end of our term-the term which Thou hast laid down for us - (we see the error of our ways]!"

AND OUT OF whatever He has created of the fruits of the field and the cattle, they assign unto God a portion, saying, "This belongs to God"-or so they [falsely] claim - "and this is for those beings who, we are convinced, have a share in God's divinity." But that which is assigned to the beings associated in their minds with God does not bring [them] closer to God - whereas that which is assigned to God brings [them but] closer to those beings to whom they ascribe a share in His divinity. Bad, indeed, is their judgment! ^qAsad6136


They assign unto Allah, of the crops and cattle which He created, a portion, and they say: "This is Allah's" - in their make-believe - "and this is for (His) partners in regard to us." Thus that which (they assign) unto His partners in them reacheth not Allah and that which (they assign) unto Allah goeth to their (so-called) partners. Evil is their ordinance. ^qPickthall6136


They appoint to God, of the tillage and cattle that He multiplied, a portion, saying, 'This is for God' -- so they assert -- 'and this is for our associates.' So what is for their associates reaches not God; and what is for God reaches their associates. Evil is their judgment! ^qArberry6136

And, likewise, their belief in beings or powers that are supposed to have a share in God's divinity makes [even] the slaying of their children seem goodly to many of those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God, thus bringing them to ruin and confusing them in their faith. Yet, unless God had so willed, they would not be doing all this: stand, therefore, aloof from them and all their false imagery! ^qAsad6137


Thus have their (so-called) partners (of Allah) made the killing of their children to seem fair unto many of the idolaters, that they may ruin them and make their faith obscure for them. Had Allah willed (it otherwise), they had not done so. So leave them alone with their devices. ^qPickthall6137

And [always] observe your bond with God: this has He enjoined upon you, so that you might keep it in mind. ^qAsad6152


And approach not the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better, till he reach maturity. Give full measure and full weight, in justice. We task not any soul beyond its scope. And if ye give your word, do justice thereunto, even though it be (against) a kinsman; and fulfil the covenant of Allah. This He commandeth you that haply ye may remember. ^qPickthall6152


And that you approach not the property of the orphan, save in the fairer manner, until he is of age. And fill up the measure and the balance with justice. We charge not any soul save to its capacity. And when you speak, be just, even if it should be to a near kinsman. And fulfil God's covenant. That then He has charged you with; haply you will remember. ^qArberry6152

And (He commandeth you, saying): This is My straight path, so follow it. Follow not other ways, lest ye be parted from His way. This hath He ordained for you, that ye may ward off (evil). ^qPickthall6153


And that this is My path, straight; so do you follow it, and follow not divers paths lest they scatter you from His path. That then He has charged you with; haply you will be godfearing.' ^qArberry6153

AND ONCE AGAIN: We vouchsafed the divine writ unto Moses in fulfilment [of Our favour] upon those who persevered in doing good, clearly spelling out everything, and [thus providing] guidance and grace, so that they might have faith in the [final] meeting with their Sustainer. ^qAsad6154


Again, We gave the Scripture unto Moses, complete for him who would do good, an explanation of all things, a guidance and a mercy, that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord. ^qPickthall6154

or lest you say, "If a divine writ had been bestowed from on high upon us, we would surely have followed its guidance better than they did." And so, a clear evidence of the truth has now come unto you from your Sustainer, and guidance, and grace. Who, then, could be more wicked than he who gives the lie to God's messages, and turns away from them in disdain? We shall requite those who turn away from Our messages in disdain with evil suffering for having thus turned away! ^qAsad6157


Or lest ye should say: If the Scripture had been revealed unto us, we surely had been better guided than are they. Now hath there come unto you a clear proof from your Lord, a guidance and mercy; and who doeth greater wrong than he who denieth the revelations of Allah, and turneth away from them? We award unto those who turn away from Our revelations an evil doom because of their aversion. ^qPickthall6157


or lest you say, 'If the Book had been sent down upon us, we had surely been more rightly guided than they.' Yet indeed a clear sign has come to you from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy; and who does greater evil than he who cries lies to God's signs, and turns away from them? We shall surely recompense those who turn away from Our signs with an evil chastisement for their turning away. ^qArberry6157

Do they, perchance, wait for the angels to appear unto them, or for thy Sustainer [Himself] to appear, or for some of thy Sustainer's [final] portents to appear? [But] on the Day when thy Sustainer's [final] portents do appear, believing will be of no avail to any human being who did not believe before, or who, while believing, did no good works. Say: "Wait, [then, for the Last Day, O unbelievers:] behold, we [believers] are waiting, too!" ^qAsad6158


Wait they, indeed, for nothing less than that the angels should come unto them, or thy Lord should come, or there should come one of the portents from thy Lord? In the day when one of the portents from thy Lord cometh, its belief availeth naught a soul which theretofore believed not, nor in its belief earned good (by works). Say: Wait ye! Lo! We (too) are waiting. ^qPickthall6158


What, do they look for the angels to come to them, nothing less, or that thy Lord should come, or that one of thy Lord's signs should come? On the day that one of thy Lord's signs comes it shall not profit a soul to believe that never believed before, or earned some good in his belief. Say: 'Watch and wait; We too are waiting.' ^qArberry6158
