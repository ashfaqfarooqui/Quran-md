They ask thee (O Muhammad) of the spoils of war. Say: The spoils of war belong to Allah and the messenger, so keep your duty to Allah, and adjust the matter of your difference, and obey Allah and His messenger, if ye are (true) believers. ^qPickthall81

And, lo, God gave you the promise that one of the two [enemy] hosts would fall to you: and you would have liked to seize the less powerful one, whereas it was God's will to prove the truth to be true in accordance with His words, and to wipe out the last remnant of those who denied the truth - ^qAsad87


And when Allah promised you one of the two bands (of the enemy) that it should be yours, and ye longed that other than the armed one might be yours. And Allah willed that He should cause the Truth to triumph by His words, and cut the root of the disbelievers; ^qPickthall87


And when God promised you one of the two parties should be yours, and you were wishing that the one not accoutred should be yours; but God was desiring to verify the truth by His words, and to cut off the unbelievers to the last remnant, ^qArberry87

[Remember how it was] when He caused inner calm to enfold you, as an assurance from Him, and sent down upon you water from the skies, so that He might purify you thereby and free you from Satan's unclean whisperings and strengthen your hearts and thus make firm your steps. ^qAsad811


When He made the slumber fall upon you as a reassurance from him and sent down water from the sky upon you, that thereby He might purify you, and remove from you the fear of Satan, and make strong your hearts and firm (your) feet thereby. ^qPickthall811


When He was causing slumber to overcome you as a security from Him, and sending down on you water from heaven, to purify you thereby, and to put away from you the defilement of Satan, and to strengthen your hearts, and to confirm your feet. ^qArberry811

Lo! Thy Sustainer inspired the angels [to convey this His message to the believers]: "I am with you!" [And He commanded the angels:] "And, give firmness unto those who have attained to faith [with these words from Me]: `I shall cast terror into the hearts of those who are bent on denying the truth; strike, then, their necks, [O believers,] and strike off every one of their finger-tips!" ^qAsad812

Zaalika bi annahum shaaaqqul laaha wa Rasoolah; wa mai yushaqiqil laaha wa Rasoolahoo fa innal laaha shadeedul 'iqaab ^qTrans813


This, because they have cut themselves off from God and His Apostle: and as for him who cuts himself off from God and His Apostle - verily, God is severe in retribution. ^qAsad813


That is because they opposed Allah and His messenger. Whoso opposeth Allah and His messenger, (for him) lo! Allah is severe in punishment. ^qPickthall813


That, because they had made a breach with God and with His Messenger; and whosoever makes a breach with God and with His Messenger, surely God is terrible in retribution. ^qArberry813

# 14

Zaalikum fazooqoohu wa anna lilkaafireena 'azaaban Naar ^qTrans814


This [for you, O enemies of God]! Taste it, then, [and know] that suffering through fire awaits those who deny the truth! ^qAsad814


That (is the award), so taste it, and (know) that for disbelievers is the torment of the Fire. ^qPickthall814


That for you; therefore taste it; and that the chastisement of the Fire is for the unbelievers. ^qArberry814

# 15

Yaaa aiyuhal lazeena aamanoo izaa laqeetumul lazeena kafaroo zahfan falaa tuwalloohumul adbaar ^qTrans815


O YOU who have attained to faith! When you meet in battle those who are bent on denying the truth, advancing in great force, do not turn your backs on them: ^qAsad815


O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your backs to them. ^qPickthall815


O believers, when you encounter the unbelievers marching to battle, turn not your backs to them. ^qArberry815

for, whoever on that day turns his back on them-unless it be in a battle manoeuvre or in an endeavour to join another troop [of the believers] - shall indeed have earned the burden of God's condemnation, and his goal shall be hell: and how vile a journey's end! ^qAsad816


Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless manoeuvring for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey's end. ^qPickthall816


Whoso turns his back that day to them, unless withdrawing to fight again or removing to join another host, he is laden with the burden of God's anger, and his refuge is Gehenna -- an evil homecoming! ^qArberry816

# 17

Falam taqtuloohum wa laakinnal laaha qatalahum; wa maa ramaita iz ramaita wa laakinnal laaha ramaa; wa liyubliyal mu'mineena minhu balaaa'an hasanaa; innal laaha Samee'un Aleem ^qTrans817


And yet, [O believers,] it was not you who slew the enemy, but it was God who slew them; and it was not thou who cast [terror into them, O Prophet], when thou didst cast it, but it was God who cast it: and [He did all this] in order that He might test the believers by a goodly test of His Own or daining. Verily, God is all-hearing, all-knowing! ^qAsad817


Ye (Muslims) slew them not, but Allah slew them. And thou (Muhammad) threwest not when thou didst throw, but Allah threw, that He might test the believers by a fair test from Him. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower. ^qPickthall817


You did not slay them, but God slew them; and when thou threwest, it was not thyself that threw, but God threw, and that He might confer on the believers a fair benefit; surely God is All-hearing, All-knowing. ^qArberry817

# 18

Zaalikum wa annal laaha moohinu kaidil kaafireen ^qTrans818


This [was God's purpose] -and also [to show] that God renders vain the artful schemes of those who deny the truth. ^qAsad818


That (is the case); and (know) that Allah (it is) Who maketh weak the plan of disbelievers. ^qPickthall818


That for you; and that God weakens the unbelievers' guile. ^qArberry818

# 19

In tastaftihoo faqad jaaa'akumul fathu wa in tantahoo fahuwa khairul lakum wa in ta'oodoo na'ud wa lan tughniya 'ankum fi'atukum shai'anw wa law kasurat wa annal laaha ma'al mu'mineen ^qTrans819


If you have been praying for victory, [O believers] - victory has now indeed come unto you. And if you abstain [from sinning], it will be for your own good; but if you revert to it, We shall revoke [Our promise of aid] - and never will your community be of any avail to you, however great its numbers: for, behold, God is [only] with those who believe! ^qAsad819


(O Qureysh!) If ye sought a judgment, now hath the judgment come unto you. And if ye cease (from persecuting the believers) it will be better for you, but if ye return (to the attack) We also shall return. And your host will avail you naught, however numerous it be, and (know) that Allah is with the believers (in His Guidance). ^qPickthall819


If victory you are seeking, victory has already come upon you; and if you give over, it is better for you. But if you return, We shall return, and your host will avail you nothing though it be numerous; and that God is with the believers. ^qArberry819

# 20

Yaaa aiyuhal lazeena aamanoo atee'ul laaha wa Rasoolahoo wa laa tawallaw 'anhu wa antum tasm'oon ^qTrans820


[Hence,] O you who have attained to faith, pay heed unto God and His Apostle, and do not turn away from Him now that you hear [His message]; ^qAsad820


O ye who believe! Obey Allah and His messenger, and turn not away from him when ye hear (him speak). ^qPickthall820


O believers, obey God and His Messenger, and do not turn away from Him, even as you are listening; ^qArberry820

# 21

Wa laa takoonoo kallazeena qaaloo sami'naa wa hum laa yasma'oon ^qTrans821


and be not like those who say, "We have heard", the while they do not hearken. ^qAsad821


Be not as those who say, we hear, and they hear not. ^qPickthall821


and be not as those who say, 'We hear,' and they hear not. ^qArberry821

# 22

Inna sharrad dawaaabbi 'indal laahis summul bukmul lazeena laa ya'qiloon ^qTrans822


Verily, the vilest of all creatures in the sight of God are those deaf, those dumb ones who do not use their reason. ^qAsad822


Lo! the worst of beasts in Allah's sight are the deaf, the dumb, who have no sense. ^qPickthall822


Surely the worst of beasts in God's sight are those that are deaf and dumb and do not understand. ^qArberry822

# 23

Wa law 'alimal laahu feehim khairal la asma'ahum; wa law asma'ahum latawallaw wa hum mu'ridoon ^qTrans823


For, if God had seen any good in them, He would certainly have made them hear: but [as it is,] even if He had made them hear, they would surely have turned away in their obstinacy. ^qAsad823


Had Allah known of any good in them He would have made them hear, but had He made them hear they would have turned away, averse. ^qPickthall823


If God had known of any good in them He would have made them hear; and if He had made them hear, they would have turned away, swerving aside. ^qArberry823

O you who have attained to faith! Respond to the call of God and the Apostle whenever he calls you unto that which will give you life; and know that God intervenes between man and [the desires of] his heart, and that unto Him you shall be gathered. ^qAsad824


O ye who believe! Obey Allah, and the messenger when He calleth you to that which quickeneth you, and know that Allah cometh in between the man and his own heart, and that He it is unto Whom ye will be gathered. ^qPickthall824


O believers, respond to God and the Messenger when He calls you unto that which will give you life; and know that God stands between a man and his heart, and that to Him you shall be mustered. ^qArberry824

Wattaqoo fitnatal laa tuseebannal lazeena zalamoo minkum khaaaassatanw wa'lamooo annal laaha shadeedul 'iqaab ^qTrans825


And beware of that temptation to evil which does not befall only those among you who are bent on denying the truth, to the exclusion of others; and know that God is severe in retribution. ^qAsad825


And guard yourselves against a chastisement which cannot fall exclusively on those of you who are wrong-doers, and know that Allah is severe in punishment. ^qPickthall825


And fear a trial which shall surely not smite in particular the evildoers among you; and know that God is terrible in retribution. ^qArberry825

And remember the time when you were few [and] helpless on earth, fearful lest people do away with you - whereupon He sheltered you, and strengthened you with His succour, and provided for you sustenance out of the good things of life, so that you might have cause to be grateful. ^qAsad826


And remember, when ye were few and reckoned feeble in the land, and were in fear lest men should extirpate you, how He gave you refuge, and strengthened you with His help, and made provision of good things for you, that haply ye might be thankful. ^qPickthall826


And remember when you were few and abased in the land, and were fearful that the people would snatch you away; but He gave you refuge, and confirmed you with His help, and provided you with the good things, that haply you might be thankful. ^qArberry826

# 27

Yaaa aiyuhal lazeena aamanoo laa takhoonal laaha war Rasoola wa takhoonooo amaanaatikum wa antum ta'lamoon ^qTrans827


[Hence,] O you who have attained to faith, do not be false to God and the Apostle, and do not knowingly be false to the trust that has been reposed in you; ^qAsad827


O ye who believe! Betray not Allah and His messenger, nor knowingly betray your trusts. ^qPickthall827


O believers, betray not God and the Messenger, and betray not your trusts and that wittingly; ^qArberry827

# 28

Wa'lamooo annamaaa amwaalukum wa awlaadukum fitnatunw wa annal laaha 'indahooo ajrun azeem ^qTrans828


and know that your worldly goods and your children are but a trial and a temptation, and that with God there is a tremendous reward. ^qAsad828


And know that your possessions and your children are a test, and that with Allah is immense reward. ^qPickthall828

O you who have attained to faith! If you remain conscious of God. He will endow you with a standard by which to discern the true from the false, and will efface your bad deeds, and will forgive you your sins: for God is limitless in His great bounty. ^qAsad829

Wa iz yamkuru bikal lazeena kafaroo liyusbitooka aw yaqtulooka aw yukhrijook; wa yamkuroona wa yamkurul laahu wallaahu khairul maakireen ^qTrans830


AND [remember, O Prophet,] how those who were bent on denying the truth were scheming against thee, in order to restrain thee [from preaching], or to slay thee, or to drive thee away: thus have they [always] schemed: but God brought their scheming to nought-for God is above all schemers. ^qAsad830


And when those who disbelieve plot against thee (O Muhammad) to wound thee fatally, or to kill thee or to drive thee forth; they plot, but Allah (also) plotteth; and Allah is the best of plotters. ^qPickthall830


And when the unbelievers were devising against thee, to confine thee, or slay thee, or to expel thee, and were devising, and God was devising; and God is the best of devisers. ^qArberry830

Wa izaa tutlaa 'alaihim Aayaatunaa qaaloo qad sami'naa law nashaaa'u laqulnaa misla haazaaa in haazaaa illaaa asaateerul awwaleen ^qTrans831


And whenever Our messages were conveyed to them, they would say, "We have heard [all this] before; if we wanted, we could certainly compose sayings like these [ourselves]: they are nothing but fables of ancient times!" ^qAsad831


And when Our revelations are recited unto them they say: We have heard. If we wish we can speak the like of this. Lo! this is naught but fables of the men of old. ^qPickthall831


And When Our signs were being recited to them, they said, 'We have already heard; if we wished, we could say the like of this; this is naught but the fairy-tales of the ancients.' ^qArberry831

Wa iz qaalul laahumma in kaana haazaa huwal haqqa min 'indika fa amtir 'alainaa hijaaratam minas samaaa'i awi'tinaa bi 'azaabin alaeem ^qTrans832


And, lo, they would say, "O God! If this. be indeed the truth from Thee, then rain down upon us stones from the skies, or inflict [some other] grievous suffering on us!" ^qAsad832


And when they said: O Allah! If this be indeed the truth from Thee, then rain down stones on us or bring on us some painful doom! ^qPickthall832

# 33

Wa maa kanal laahu liyu'az zibahum wa anta feehim; wa maa kaanal laahu mu'az zibahum wa hum yastaghfiroon ^qTrans833


But God did not choose thus to chastise them whip thou [O Prophet] wert still among them, nor would God chastise them when they [might yet] ask for forgiveness. ^qAsad833


But Allah would not punish them while thou wast with them, nor will He punish them while they seek forgiveness. ^qPickthall833


But God would never chastise them, with thee among them; God would never chastise them as they begged forgiveness. ^qArberry833

But what have they [now] in their favour that God should not chastise them-seeing that they bar [the believers] from the Inviolable House of Worship, although they are not its [rightful] guardians? None but the God-conscious can be its guardians: but of this most of these [evildoers] are unaware; ^qAsad834


What (plea) have they that Allah should not punish them, when they debar (His servants) from the Inviolable Place of Worship, though they are not its fitting guardians. Its fitting guardians are those only who keep their duty to Allah. But most of them know not. ^qPickthall834


But what have they now, that God should not chastise them, when they are barring from the Holy Mosque, not being its protectors? Its only protectors are the godfearing; but most of them know not. ^qArberry834

# 35

Wa maa kaana Salaatuhum 'indal Baiti illa mukaaa anw-wa tasdiyah; fazooqul 'azaaba bimaa kuntum takfuroon ^qTrans835


and their prayers before the Temple are nothing but whistling and clapping of hands. Taste then, [O unbelievers,] this chastisement as an outcome of your persistent denial of the truth! ^qAsad835


And their worship at the (holy) House is naught but whistling and hand-clapping. Therefore (it is said unto them): Taste of the doom because ye disbelieve. ^qPickthall835

Behold, those who are bent on denying the truth are spending their riches in order to turn others away from the path of God; and they will go on spending them until they become [a source of] intense regret for them; and then they will be overcome! And those who [until their death] have denied the truth shall be gathered unto hell, ^qAsad836


Lo! those who disbelieve spend their wealth in order that they may debar (men) from the way of Allah. They will spend it, then it will become an anguish for them, then they will be conquered. And those who disbelieve will be gathered unto hell, ^qPickthall836

Now enjoy what ye have won, as lawful and good, and keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. ^qPickthall869


Eat of what you have taken as booty, such as is lawful and good; and fear you God; surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate. ^qArberry869

[Hence,] O Prophet, say unto the captives who are in your hands: "If God finds any good in your hearts, He will give you something better than all that has been taken from you, and will forgive you your sins: for God is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace." ^qAsad870


O Prophet! Say unto those captives who are in your hands: If Allah knoweth any good in your hearts He will give you better than that which hath been taken from you, and will forgive you. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. ^qPickthall870


O Prophet, say to the prisoners in your hands: 'If God knows of any good in your hearts He will give you better than what has been taken from you, and He will forgive you; surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.' ^qArberry870

And should they but seek to play false with thee -well, they were false to God [Himself] ere this: but He gave [the believers] mastery over them. And God is all-knowing, wise. ^qAsad871


And if they would betray thee, they betrayed Allah before, and He gave (thee) power over them. Allah is Knower, Wise. ^qPickthall871


And if they desire treachery against thee, they have tricked God before; but He has given thee power over them; and God is All-knowing, All-wise. ^qArberry871

Innal lazeena aamanoo wa haajaroo wa jaahadoo bi amwaalihim wa anfusihim fee sabeelil laahi wallazeena aawaw wa nasarooo ulaaa'ika ba'duhum awliyaaa'u ba'd; wallazeena aamanoo wa lam yuhaajiroo maa lakum minw walaayatihim min shai'in hatta yuhaajiroo; wa inistan sarookum fid deeni fa'alaiku munnasru illaa 'alaa qawmim bainakum wa bainahum meesaaq; wallaahu bimaa ta'maloona Baseer ^qTrans872


BEHOLD, as for those who have attained to faith, and who have forsaken the domain of evil and are striving hard, with their possessions and their lives, in God's cause, as well as those who shelter and succour [them] - these are [truly] the friends and protectors of one another. But as for those who have come to believe without having migrated [to your country] - you are in no wise responsible for their protection until such a time as they migrate [to you]. Yet, if they ask you for succour against religious persecution, it is your duty to give [them] this succour-except against a people between whom and yourselves there is a covenant: for God sees all that you do. ^qAsad872


Lo! those who believed and left their homes and strove with their wealth and their lives for the cause of Allah, and those who took them in and helped them: these are protecting friends one of another. And those who believed but did not leave their homes, ye have no duty to protect them till they leave their homes; but if they seek help from you in the matter of religion then it is your duty to help (them) except against a folk between whom and you there is a treaty. Allah is Seer of what ye do. ^qPickthall872


Those who believe, and have emigrated and struggled with their possessions and their selves in the way of God, and those who have given refuge and help -- those are friends one of another. And those who believe, but have not emigrated -- you have no duty of friendship towards them till they emigrate; yet if they ask you for help, for religion's sake, it is your duty to help them, except against a people between whom and you there is a compact; and God sees the things you do. ^qArberry872

With all this, [remember that] those who are bent on denying the truth are allies of one another; and unless you act likewise [among yourselves], oppression will reign on earth, and great corruption. ^qAsad873


And those who disbelieve are protectors one of another - If ye do not so, there will be confusion in the land, and great corruption. ^qPickthall873


As for the unbelievers, they are friends one of another. Unless you do this, there will be persecution in the land and great corruption. ^qArberry873

And they who have attained to faith, and who have forsaken the domain of evil and are striving hard in God's cause, as well as those who shelter and succour [them]-it is they, they who are truly believers! Forgiveness of sins awaits them, and a most excellent sustenance. ^qAsad874


Those who believed and left their homes and strove for the cause of Allah, and those who took them in and helped them - these are the believers in truth. For them is pardon, and bountiful provision. ^qPickthall874


And those who believe, and have emigrated and struggled in the way of God. those who have given refuge and help those in truth are the believers, and theirs shall be forgiveness and generous provision. ^qArberry874

And as for those who henceforth come to believe, and who forsake the domain of evil and strive hard [in God's cause] together with you - these [too] shall belong to you; and they who are [thus] closely related have the highest claim on one another in [accordance with] God's decree. Verily, God has full knowledge of everything. ^qAsad875


And those who afterwards believed and left their homes and strove along with you, they are of you; and those who are akin are nearer one to another in the ordinance of Allah. Lo! Allah is Knower of all things. ^qPickthall875


And those who have believed afterwards and emigrated, and struggled with you -- they belong to you; but those related by blood are nearer to one another in the Book of God; surely God has knowledge of everything. ^qArberry875
