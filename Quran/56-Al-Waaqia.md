Afabihaazal hadeesi antum mudhinoon ^qTrans5681


Would you, now, look down with disdain on a tiding like this, ^qAsad5681


Is it this Statement that ye scorn, ^qPickthall5681


What, do you hold this discourse in disdain, ^qArberry5681

# 82

Wa taj'aloona rizqakum annakum tukazziboon ^qTrans5682


and make it your daily bread [as it were] to call the truth a lie? ^qAsad5682

Thus if he is of those brought nigh, ^qPickthall5688


Then, if he be of those brought nigh the Throne, ^qArberry5688

But if he be of them that cried lies, and went astray, ^qArberry5692

# 93

Fanuzulum min hameem ^qTrans5693


a welcome of burning despair [awaits him in the life to come,] ^qAsad5693
