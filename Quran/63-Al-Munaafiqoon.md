Izaa jaaa'akal munaafiqoona qaaloo nashhadu innaka la rasoolul laah; wallaahu ya'lamu innaka la rasooluhoo wallaahu yashhadu innal munaafiqeena lakaaziboon ^qTrans620


WHEN THE HYPOCRITES come unto thee, they say, "We bear witness that thou art indeed God's Apostle!" But God knows that thou art truly His Apostle; and He bears witness that the hypocrites are indeed false [in their declaration of faith]. ^qAsad620


When the hypocrites come unto thee (O Muhammad), they say: We bear witness that thou art indeed Allah's messenger. And Allah knoweth that thou art indeed His messenger, and Allah beareth witness that the hypocrites indeed are speaking falsely. ^qPickthall620

Ittakhazoo aymaanahum junnatan fasaddoo 'an sabeelil laah; innahum saaa'a maa kaanoo ya'maloon ^qTrans621


They have made their oaths a cover [for their falseness], and thus they turn others away from the Path of God. Evil indeed is all that they are wont to do: ^qAsad621


They make their faith a pretext so that they may turn (men) from the way of Allah. Verily evil is that which they are wont to do, ^qPickthall621


They have taken their oaths as a covering, then they have barred from the way of God. Surely they -- evil are the things they have been doing. ^qArberry621

Zaalika bi annahum aamanoo summa kafaroo fatubi'a 'alaa quloobihim fahum laa yafqahoon ^qTrans622


this, because [they profess that] they have attained to faith, whereas [inwardly] they deny the truth - and so, a seal has been set on their hearts so that they can no longer understand [what is true and what false]. ^qAsad622


That is because they believed, then disbelieved, therefore their hearts are sealed so that they understand not. ^qPickthall622


That is because they have believed, then they have disbelieved; therefore a seal has been set on their hearts, and they do not understand. ^qArberry622

Wa izaa ra aytahum tu'jibuka ajsaamuhum wa iny yaqooloo tasma' liqawlihim kaannahum khushubum musannadah; yahsaboona kulla saihatin 'alaihim; humul 'aduwwu fahzarhum; qaatalahumul laahu annaa yu'fakoon ^qTrans623


Now when thou seest them, their outward appearance may please thee; and when they speak, thou art inclined to lend ear to what they say. [But though they may seem as sure of themselves] as if they were timbers [firmly] propped up, they think that every shout is [directed] against them. They are the [real] enemies [of all faith], so beware of them. [They deserve the imprecation,] "May God destroy them!" How perverted are their minds! ^qAsad623


And when thou seest them their figures please thee; and if they speak thou givest ear unto their speech. (They are) as though they were blocks of wood in striped cloaks. They deem every shout to be against them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. Allah confound them! How they are perverted! ^qPickthall623


When thou seest them, their bodies please thee; but when they speak, thou listenest to their speech, and it is as they were propped-up timbers. They think every cry is against them. They are the enemy; so beware of them. God assail them! How they are perverted! ^qArberry623

Wa izaa qeela lahum ta'aalaw yastaghfir lakum rasoolul laahi lawwaw ru'oo sahum wa ra aytahum yasuddoona wa hum mustakbiroon ^qTrans624


for, when they are told, "Come, the Apostle of God will pray [unto God] that you be forgiven", they turn their heads away, and thou canst see how they draw back in their false pride. ^qAsad624


And when it is said unto them: Come! The messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for you! they avert their faces and thou seest them turning away, disdainful. ^qPickthall624


And when it is said to them, 'Come now, and God's Messenger will ask forgiveness for you,' they twist their heads, and thou seest them turning their faces away, waxing proud. ^qArberry624

Sawaaa'un 'alaihim as taghfarta lahum am lam tastaghfir lahum lany yaghfiral laahu lahum; innal laaha laa yahdil qawmal faasiqeen ^qTrans625


As for them it is all the same whether thou dost pray that they be forgiven or dost not pray for them: God will nor forgive them - for, behold, God does not bestow His guidance upon such iniquitous folk. ^qAsad625


Whether thou ask forgiveness for them or ask not forgiveness for them is all one for them; Allah will not forgive them. Lo! Allah guideth not the evil-living folk. ^qPickthall625


Equal it is for them, whether thou askest forgiveness for them or thou askest not forgiveness for them; God will never forgive them. God guides not the people of the ungodly. ^qArberry625

Humul lazeena yaqooloona laa tunfiqoo 'alaa man inda Rasoolil laahi hatta yanfaddoo; wa lillaahi khazaaa' inus samaawaati wal ardi wa laakinnal munaafiqeena la yafqahoon ^qTrans626


It is they who say [to their compatriots], "Do not spend anything on those who are with God's Apostle, so that they [may be forced to] leave." However, unto God belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth: but this truth the hypocrites cannot grasp. ^qAsad626


They it is who say: Spend not on behalf of those (who dwell) with Allah's messenger that they may disperse (and go away from you); when Allah's are the treasures of the heavens and the earth; but the hypocrites comprehend not. ^qPickthall626


Those are they that say, 'Do not expend on them that are with God's Messenger until they scatter off'; yet unto God belong the treasuries of the heavens and of the earth, but the hypocrites do not understand. ^qArberry626

Yaqooloona la'ir raja'naaa ilal madeenati la yukhrijanal a'azzu minhal azall; wa lillaahil 'izzatu wa li Rasoolihee wa lilmu'mineena wa laakinnal munaafiqeena laa ya'lamoon ^qTrans627


[And] they say, "Indeed, when we return to the City [we,] the ones most worthy of honour will surely drive out therefrom those most contemptible ones!" However, all honour belongs to God, and [thus] to His Apostle and those who believe [in God]: but of this the hypocrites are not aware. ^qAsad627


They say: Surely, if we return to Al-Madinah the mightier will soon drive out the weaker; when might belongeth to Allah and to His messenger and to the believers; but the hypocrites know not. ^qPickthall627


They say, 'If we return to the City, the mightier ones of it will expel the more abased'; yet glory belongs unto God, and unto His Messenger and the believers, but the hypocrites do not know it. ^qArberry627

Yaaa ayyuhal lazeena aamanoo la tulhikum amwaalukum wa laa awlaadukum 'anzikril laah; wa mai-yaf'al zaalika fa-ulaaa'ika humul khaasiroon ^qTrans628


O YOU who have attained to faith! Let not your worldly goods or your children make you oblivious of the remembrance of God: for If any behave thus - it is they, they who are the losers! ^qAsad628


O ye who believe! Let not your wealth nor your children distract you from remembrance of Allah. Those who do so, they are the losers. ^qPickthall628


O believers, let not your possessions neither your children divert you from God's remembrance; whoso does that, they are the losers. ^qArberry628

Wa anifqoo mim maa razaqnaakum min qabli any-yaatiya ahadakumul mawtu fa yaqoola rabbi law laaa akhkhartaneee ilaaa ajalin qareebin fa assaddaqa wa akum minassaaliheen ^qTrans629


And spend on others out of what We have provided for you as sustenance, ere there come a time when death approaches any of you, and he then says, "O my Sustainer! If only Thou wouldst grant me a delay for a short while, so that I could give in charity and be among the righteous!" ^qAsad629


And spend of that wherewith We have provided you before death cometh unto one of you and he saith: My Lord! If only thou wouldst reprieve me for a little while, then I would give alms and be among the righteous. ^qPickthall629


Expend of what We have provided you before that death comes upon one of you and he says, 'O my Lord, if only Thou wouldst defer me unto a near term, so that I may make freewill offering, and so I may become one of the righteous.' ^qArberry629

Wa lany yu 'akhkhiral laahu nafsan izaa jaaa'a ajaluhaa; wallaahu khabeerum bimaa ta'maloon ^qTrans6210


But never does God grant a delay to a human being when his term has come; and God is fully aware of all that you do. ^qAsad6210


But Allah reprieveth no soul when its term cometh, and Allah is Informed of what ye do. ^qPickthall6210


But God will never defer any soul when its term comes. And God is aware of the things you do. ^qArberry6210
